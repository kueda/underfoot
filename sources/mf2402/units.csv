af,Artificial fill (Holocene (Historic)),,"Man-made deposit of various materials.  Some are compacted and quite firm, especially in earthen dams, but other fills made before 1965 are nearly everywhere not compacted and consist simply of dumped materials.  Only two bodies of this unit are shown on the map, one in the Warm Springs Dam and one in the Arched Rock quadrangle.  The many other bodies of this unit are too small to be shown at map scale"
Qal,Alluvial fan and fluvial deposits (Quaternary),,"Alluvial fan deposits are brown or tan, medium dense to dense, gravelly sand or sandy gravel that generally grade upward to sandy or silty clay.  Near the distal fan edges, the fluvial deposits are typically brown, never reddish, medium dense sand that fines upward to sandy or silty clay.  This unit also includes floodplain deposits: medium to dark gray, dense, sandy to silty clay.  Lenses of coarser material (silt, sand, and pebbles) may be locally present.  In addition, this unit includes natural levee deposits: loose, moderately sorted to well-sorted sandy or clayey silt grading to sandy or silty clay.  These deposits are porous and permeable and provide conduits for transport of ground water.  Levee deposits border stream channels, usually both banks, and slope away to flatter floodplains.  This unit also includes stream channel deposits: poorly sorted to well-sorted sand, silt, silty sand, or sandy gravel with minor cobbles.  Cobbles are more common in the mountain valleys. At the mouth of the Russian and Gualala Rivers and the two esteros in the Valley Ford quadrangle, this unit also includes bay mud (Qm)"
Qm,Bay mud (Quaternary),,"Water saturated estuarine mud, predominantly gray, green, and blue clay and silty clay underlying marshlands and tidal mud flats.  The mud also contains a few lenses of well-sorted, fine sand and silt, a few shelly layers (oysters), and peat.  This unit is mapped separately only in the Bodega Head quadrangle"
Qs,Beach and dune sand (Quaternary),,"Fine-grained, very well sorted, well-drained, eolian deposits.  They occur mainly in large sheets, as well as many small hills, most displaying Barchan morphology.  Dunes display as much as 30 m of erosional relief and are presently being buried by bay mud (Qm).  They probably began accumulating after the last interglacial high stand of sea level began to recede about 71 ka, continued to form when sea level dropped to its Wisconsin minimum about 20-15 ka, and probably ceased to accumulate after sea level reached its present elevation (about 6 ka)"
Qls,Landslide deposits (Quaternary),,"Poorly sorted clay, silt, sand, gravel, boulders, and rock masses. Only a few large landslides are shown.  For a more complete map of landslide deposits, see Nilsen and others (1979)"
Qt,Alluvial and marine terrace deposits (Pleistocene),,"Deposits consist of crudely bedded, clast-supported gravels, cobbles, and boulders with a sandy matrix.  Clasts as much as 35 cm intermediate diameter are present.  Coarse sand lenses may be locally present.  Alluvial terrace deposits lie on flat surfaces cut into bedrock a few meters that are up to several tens of meters above Qal deposits. Marine terrace deposits lie on one or more flights of flat surfaces that are cut into bedrock and lie up to 275 m above present sea level.  These terrace deposits are the remnants of an older alluvial system that have been lifted above present depositional levels by tectonic uplift associated with regional transpression"
Qpoaf,Older alluvial fan deposits (Pleistocene),,"Roughly horizontal beds of buff siltstone and claystone, buff to gray, fine- to coarse-grained lithic sandstone, pebbly sandstone, pebbly mudstone, and pebble to cobble conglomerate.  Clasts include silicic to intermediate volcanics, obsidian, varicolored chert, graywacke and metagraywacke, quartzite, metachert, hornfels, quartz, charcoal, and petrified wood. Previously mapped (Blake and others, 1971; Fox, 1983) as Glen Ellen Formation based on similar clast composition (especially obsidian), we differentiate Qpoaf from QTge based on the lack of deformation and volcanics interbedded in Qpoaf and because Qpoaf is softer and less resistant than QTge.   Qpoaf deposits probably formed as a large alluvial fan system at the west edge of hills and ridges underlain by Glen Ellen Formation and Sonoma Volcanics during uplift and transpression related to the Rodgers Creek/Healdsburg Fault Zone.  Much Qpoaf detritus is probably reworked from the Glen Ellen Formation.  This unit is at least 65 m thick.  It is incised and overlain by Qal.  This unit may be coeval in part with Qt  and related in part to the same older alluvial system"
Qr,Rhyolite and rhyodacite (Pleistocene),Clear Lake Volcanic Complex,"Porphyritic biotite rhyolite and rhyodacite flows.  Contains parts of the rhyolite of Alder Creek and rhyodacite of Cobb Mountain of Hearn and others (1995). Rhyolite has yielded radiometric ages of 1.11+0.02 to 1.15+0.02 Ma, and rhyodacite has yielded ages of 1.05+0.02 to 1.06+0.02 Ma (Hearn and others, 1995)"
Qob,Olivine basalt (Pleistocene),Clear Lake Volcanic Complex,"Olivine-rich basalt flows, dikes, and diatreme breccia.  Equivalent to the olivine basalt of Caldwell Pines of Hearn and others (1995).  The basalt has yielded a radiometric age of 1.66+0.12 Ma (Hearn and others, 1995)"
QTge,Glen Ellen Formation (Pleistocene(?) and Pliocene),,"Brown- to buff-weathering, interbedded siltstone, fine- to coarse-grained sandstone, pebbly and cobbly sandstone, conglomerate, and tuff.  Sandstone is tuffaceous or feldspathic arenite.  Coarse clasts include mafic to silicic volcanics, obsidian, pumice, varicolored chert, and graywacke.  The eastern part of the Glen Ellen Formation (mapped as QTget) contains more interbeds of tuff. Radiometric ages from interbedded tuff show that the Glen Ellen Formation is 3.1 Ma or younger (McLaughlin and others, 1999).  The basal part of the Glen Ellen Formation is coeval with and interfingers with the upper part of the Sonoma Volcanics"
QTget,Eastern part of the Glen Ellen Formation (Pleistocene(?) and Pliocene),,"Brown- to buff-weathering, interbedded siltstone, fine- to coarse-grained sandstone, pebbly and cobbly sandstone, conglomerate, and tuff.

Tor,Ohlson Ranch Formation (Pliocene),,"Mostly horizontal, thick beds of buff weathering, white to light-gray, well-consolidated, soft, quartz-lithic arenite.  Also includes buff-weathering gray siltstone, pebbly to cobbly sandstone and conglomerate, red lithic sandstone, and white tuff.  A tuff bed near the base of the unit in the Plantation quadrangle has been correlated (Sarna-Wojcicki, 1976) with the Nomlaki Tuff, which has yielded a radiometric age of 3.3 + 0.4 Ma (Everndon and others, 1964).  Locally concentrated Pliocene marine molluscan fossils have also been identified from this unit (Peck, 1960).  This formation lies in angular unconformity over Franciscan Complex rocks and in at least one location (Soda Springs Road in the Annapolis quadrangle) includes slabs as much as 10 m long of the underlying rock.  For a more complete description of the formation, see Higgins (1960)."
Tors,"sandstone, Ohlson Ranch Formation (Pliocene)",,

Tls,Sedimentary rocks of Little Sulphur Creek (Pliocene and (or) Miocene),,"Confined to a narrow band in the northeast part of the map area (Asti, The Geysers, and Jimtown quadrangles), this unit is composed of massive to distinctly bedded boulder to pebble conglomerate and breccia, lithic sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone.  Coarse clasts in places exceed 3 m in length and include varicolored chert, blueschist, graywacke, gabbro, serpentinite, diabase, and basalt, probably derived from surrounding Mesozoic rocks.  One clast of middle Miocene fossiliferous arkose has also been found (McLaughlin and Nilsen, 1982), but no similar rock is known from the surrounding area.  Freshwater ostracod and gastropod fossils have been reported from this unit, as have brackish or marine foraminifers, but none of these fossils provide good age control (Gealey, 1951; McNitt, 1968; McLaughlin and Nilsen, 1982).  A Miocene or younger whale vertebra has also been reported (McNitt, 1968), but given the partly nonmarine nature of the unit, it is possible that this fossil was reworked from an older unit, perhaps the same as the fossiliferous arkose clast.  McLaughlin and Nilsen (1982) interpreted this unit to have formed in a fault basin associated with a right step in the Maacama Fault Zone and suggested the unit was 3 Ma or younger based on the timing of initiation of San Andreas Fault system activity at this latitude.  However, it is possible that the fault basin was related to a pre-San Andreas structure.  Therefore, the age of the unit can only be constrained with confidence to post-date the middle Miocene age of the included arkose clast"
Tsa,"Andesite, Sonoma Volcanics (Pliocene and Miocene)",Sonoma Volcanic Complex,Plagioclase and plagioclase-hornblende porphyry andesite flow rock.  Also includes minor plagioclase-quartz porphyry dacite flow rock

Twg,Wilson Grove Formation (late Pliocene to late Miocene),,"Mostly massive or thick-bedded, buff-weathering, light-gray, fine-grained quartz-lithic arenite.  Also locally includes beds of mollusk- and gastropod- shell hash, pebble to boulder conglomerate, and tuff.  Fossils from the Wilson Grove Formation range in age from late Miocene to late Pliocene (C. Powell, oral commun.; Travis, 1952; Naidu, 1999).  The lower part of the unit overlies and is interbedded with late Miocene and early Pliocene basalt flow rock (Tb).  At least part of the Wilson Grove Formation is probably the marine equivalent of the estuarine sand and gravel of Cotati and the alluvial Petaluma Formation."
Twgt,"Tuff (late Miocene), Wilson Grove Formation",,"White, water-lain tuff and pumice breccia.  Informally named Roblar tuff by Sarna- Wojcicki (1992), this tuff has yielded K/Ar ages ranging from 5.68+0.68 to 6.26+0.1 (Bartow and others, 1973; Sarna-Wojcicki, 1976; Fox and others, 1985a)"
Tc,Sand and gravel of Cotati (Pliocene and late Miocene),,"Thick-bedded to massive, white quartz arenite, buff-weathering siltstone, and pebble conglomerate.  Coarse clasts include varicolored chert; gray or brown laminated chert; red, gray, and white quartz- and plagioclase-porphyry volcanics; black basalt; blueschist; graywacke; greenstone; quartz; and black hornfels.  Locally present within the sandstone beds are estuarine mollusk, crustacean, and gastropod fossils.  The laminated chert clasts may be derived from middle Miocene Monterey or Claremont Formation cherts (Fox, 1983), although the nearest outcrop of these units is several tens of kilometers to the southeast.  However, offset on the Hayward-Rodgers Creek/Healdsburg and the Hayward-Tolay/Petaluma River Faults have probably moved the sand and gravel of Cotati and Wilson Grove Formation about 60 km from the southeast since deposition of the sand and gravel of Cotati.  The sand and gravel of Cotati overlies and is interbedded with late Miocene and early Pliocene basalt flow rock (Tb), overlies the  rhyolite intrusive breccia of the Donnell Ranch volcanics of Youngman (1989; Tdb), and interfingers on the west with the marine Wilson Grove Formation.  The age of the sand and gravel of Cotati is not as well constrained as that of the Wilson Grove Formation, but must postdate the underlying Donnell Ranch volcanics (Tdb, about 9.3 Ma) and include the age of interlayered basalt (Tb, 4.26±0.27 Ma).  Because it interfingers with the Wilson Grove Formation, we consider the sand and gravel of Cotati to be the estuarine equivalent of at least part of the Wilson Grove Formation.  The sand and gravel of Cotati is probably also the estuarine equivalent of at least part of the alluvial Petaluma Formation.  The sand and gravel of Cotati is in places indistinguishable from the Petaluma Formation, although some beds may be distinguished by having estuarine fossils or by having small, very spherical pebbles in conglomerate.  Because the sand and gravel of Cotati is so similar in places to the Petaluma Formation, we have mapped the boundary between the two units at the Petaluma Valley Fault, which separates verifiable sand and gravel of Cotati outcrops from the main extent of Petaluma Formation.  However, the two formations probably interfingered during deposition, and therefore some of what is mapped herein as sand and gravel of Cotati might actually be Petaluma Formation"
Tp,Petaluma Formation (Pliocene and late Miocene),,"Only the northwesternmost part of the outcrop area of this formation is within the map area (Two Rock quadrangle), although oil-well data show that it extends under Santa Rosa Valley (D. Zigler, written commun.).  Gray weathering, brown and green pebble- and cobble- conglomerate, gritstone, lithic and quartz-lithic arenite, and mudstone.  Coarse clasts include varicolored chert, quartz- and plagioclase-porphyry rhyolite and andesite, vesicular andesite, laminated rhyolite, white tuff, basalt, quartz, graywacke, greenstone, and laminated chert.  Locally present within the sandstone and conglomerate are land-mammal fossils, and lacustrine and estuarine ostracods (Liniecki-Laporte and Anderson, 1988) have been found in the mudstone.  Mammalian fossils originally described as late Pliocene (Stirton, 1939) are now known to be late Miocene (late Hemphilian, McFadden, 1998).  However, early Pliocene mammalian fossils have been found elsewhere within the unit (early Blancan; Bartow and others, 1973; Davies, 1986).  East of the map area, the Petaluma Formation also includes a tuff bed correlated with Twgt (Sarna-Wojckici, 1976) and a layer of basalt flow rock dated at 8.52±0.18 Ma (Fox and others, 1985a).  The Petaluma Formation overlies and interfingers with the Donnell Ranch volcanics of Youngman (1989) at its base (Fox, 1983; Youngman, 1989) and is coeval with (and may interfinger with) the lower part of the Sonoma Volcanics at its top.  It is probably the nonmarine equivalent of the estuarine sand and gravel of Cotati and marine Wilson Grove Formation.  As described above, the sand and gravel of Cotati and the Petaluma Formation are in part indistinguishable, and strata that include estuarine ostracods that were previously mapped as Petaluma Formation would be considered by us to be interfingered sand and gravel of Cotati.  The Petaluma Formation lies mostly east of the Petaluma River Fault and has been offset about 35 km from the Wilson Grove and sand and gravel of Cotati west of the fault.  It has also been offset about 25 km by movement on the Rodgers Creek-Healdsburg Fault from its original depositional position"

Tb,Undivided basalt (Pliocene and Miocene),,"Black basalt, plagioclase porphyry basalt and andesite, and vesicular basalt and andesite flow rock.  In the map area, outcrops of Tb have yielded radiometric ages ranging from 4.26±0.27 Ma to 7.83±0.29 Ma (Fox and others, 1985a).  However, Tb also includes older basalt which is intruded by Tdb.  We correlate this older basalt with either an older part of the Donnell Ranch volcanics of Youngman (1989) or the about 12 Ma Burdell Mountain volcanics of Blake and others (2000; the nearest verified outcrop of Burdell Mountain volcanics is at Meecham Hill, Cotati quadrangle, just southeast of the map area)"

This unit also locally includes disrupted, thin-bedded sandstone and blue-gray weathering, greenish- gray or dark-gray shale or slate.  Structural disruption ranges from shearing evident in the fine-grained beds to dismemberment into lenses of sandstone (boudins) in a sheared shale matrix.  The zeolite mineral laumontite is visible in veins and shear zones throughout the unit.  This unit has yielded Paleocene and Eocene palynomorphs north of the map area (Bachman, 1978) and overlies middle Eocene to Late Cretaceous basalt and pelagic limestone (Bachman, 1978; Sliter, 1984).  The feldspathic-lithic part of the unit (not mapped separately) is lithologically indistinguishable from TKfs and parts of Kfss"

Kfss,"Sandstone (Late Cretaceous, Turonian to Campanian), Franciscan Complex",Franciscan Complex ,"Massive to distinctly bedded, brown-weathering, green, gray, or white, feldspathic and feldspathic-lithic wacke.  In the Bodega Head quadrangle, this unit consists of distinctly bedded white and gray, K-feldspar- and biotite-bearing feldspathic wacke and dark-gray shale. Similar rocks south of the map area contain Late Cretaceous (Campanian) fossils (Bailey and others, 1964).  In the Lake Sonoma area (Warm Springs, Tombs Creek, and Bigfoot Mountain quadrangles), the unit consists of massive to distinctly bedded, buff-weathering, gray, K-feldspar- and biotite-bearing feldspathic-lithic wacke, pebbly wacke, and conglomerate, and dark-gray concretionary shale.  Coarse clasts include graywacke, shale, limestone (concretions, some fossiliferous), greenstone, and chert.  The unit in this area overlies chert and greenstone and has yielded a Late Cretaceous (Turonian) Inoceramus labiatus (Bailey and others, 1964).  Other than this fossil and the presence of chert, this unit is indistinguishable from TKfs and the feldspathic-lithic part of TKfss.  In the northeasternmost part of the area (Jimtown, Geyserville, Asti, The Geysers, and Highland Springs quadrangles), this unit is composed of distinctly bedded, brown-weathering, greenish-gray, muscovite- and K-feldspar-bearing feldspathic-lithic wacke and dark-gray, mica-bearing siltstone and slate.  The sandstone in this area has locally an incipient foliation (textural zone 2A of Jayko and others, 1986), bears muscovite instead of biotite, and has not yielded age-diagnostic fossils but is otherwise similar to the wacke near Lake Sonoma as well as TKfs and the feldspathic-lithic part of TKfss.  These rocks are mapped as Kfss because of their structural position east of Lake Sonoma"

Because contacts between coherent graywacke and mŽlange are gradational (derived from different amounts of shearing) and because of the size and amount of cover in the map area, it was not possible in this study to differentiate everywhere between coherent graywacke and mŽlange.  Where observed, coherent graywacke masses within the unit are indicated by a green hachure, while large observed blocks that are too small to map at 1:100,000 scale are indicated by diamonds (high-grade) and triangles (low-grade), and structural bodies known to be comprised primarily of mŽlange are mapped separately (fsr).  Coherent graywacke bodies also locally include conglomerate, pebbly sandstone, and rare thin beds of red and white chert.  Coarse clasts include black chert, quartzite, hornfels, granite, rhyolite, lithic wacke, blueschist, greenstone, green chert, marble, amphibolite, and quartz-mica schist. In many places, the graywacke contains conspicuous large chips of black and green shale.  Coherent sedimentary rocks range from completely unfoliated to moderately foliated (Textural Zones 1-2A of Jayko and others, 1986). Late Jurassic (Tithonian) fossils have been found in both the coherent graywacke and the mŽlange matrix (Bailey and others, 1964; D.L. Jones, written commun.).  Interbedded chert from the Asti quadrangle has been sampled, but not yet processed for microfossils.  Interbedded chert in similar coherent graywacke in Marin County has yielded Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous microfossils (Murchey and Jones, 1984).  Chert pebbles from conglomerate have yielded Late Triassic to Early Jurassic microfossils (Seiders and Blome, 1984).  Graywacke in this unit is distinguished from most other Franciscan Complex graywacke by its high lithic content.

Type III metabasalt is interlayered with pink, green, brown, or blue metachert, dark-brown or bluish-black metashale and metaironstone, and white, aragonite-bearing metacarbonate.  The original textures (pillows, vesicles, amygdules) are generally preserved in Type II metabasalt, but are mostly obliterated in Type III.  The contact between Type II and III metabasalts is gradational.  In some structural blocks, Type II metabasalt grades into Type I greenstone, which lacks blueschist-facies metamorphic minerals, but Type III metabasalt does not crop out in those areas.  Structural blocks containing Type II and III metabasalt are indicated on the map by a black hachured pattern, whereas those blocks containing only Type I and II metabasalt are unhachured.  Geochemical analysis of the higher grade part of the unit suggests it was derived from a seamount (Coleman and Lee, 1963) that was subducted to a maximum depth of about 20 km (P=9.5-12 kb, T=360-380¡C; Maruyama and Liou, 1988; Moore and Blake, 1989; Oh, 1990; Oh and others, 1991).  Type III metashale has yielded K/Ar metamorphic ages of 130-135 Ma (Lee and others, 1964), and Ward Creek metabasalt (presumably Type III) has yielded an Ar/Ar metamorphic age of 142.6±0.5 Ma (Wakabayashi and Deino, 1989).  Other reported metamorphic ages for higher grade (type not specified) rocks of this unit are 135±7 Ma to 150±7.5 Ma (K/Ar; Coleman and Lanphere, 1971), 130-140 Ma (Ar/Ar, K/Ar; Wakabayashi, 1999a), and 133.1±6.7 to 153.6±7.7 Ma (K/Ar, Rb/Sr; Kelley, 1982)"
KJgv,"Sandstone, shale, and conglomerate (Early Cretaceous and Late Jurassic)",Great Valley Sequence,"Distinctly bedded, brown-weathering, dark-gray to white, biotite- and muscovite-lithic wacke and siltstone, dark-gray siltstone and shale, and pebble to boulder conglomerate.  Coarse clasts include quartz- and plagioclase-porphyry volcanics, granitic rocks, gray rhyolite tuff, and chert.  Sparse Late Jurassic (Tithonian) and Early Cretaceous (Valanginian) molluscan fossils have been found throughout the unit west of the Maacama Fault (Bailey and others, 1964; Travis, 1952; Christensen, 1973; Gealey, 1951), whereas east of the Maacama Fault the strata have yielded Early Cretaceous (Hauterivian-Barremian) fossils (McLaughlin and Ohlin, 1984; D.L Jones, written commun.)."

Jk,Knoxville Formation (Late Jurassic),Great Valley Sequence,Distinctly-bedded black shale and thin beds of biotite-lithic wacke that contain only Late Jurassic fossils.  Mapped only in the Camp Meeker quadrangle
Jsv,Keratophyre and quartz keratophyre tuff (Late Jurassic),Great Valley Sequence,"This unit is only mapped in one small area in Camp Meeker quadrangle.  Highly altered, distinctly bedded, red, green, and white intermediate and silicic tuff. Feldspars are almost all replaced by albite.  Contains Late Jurassic (Tithonian) radiolarians and bright green celadonite crystals.  Probably correlative with tuff of the Lotta Creek Formation of the western San Joaquin Valley hundreds of kilometers southeast of the map area.  This unit also includes minor amounts of augite- porphyry breccia.  These rocks are probably the altered remnants of tuff and volcanic detritus derived from a volcanic arc and deposited on the Coast Range ophiolite.  The presence of Lotta Creek Formation tuff here is indicative of the large amounts of fault offset experienced by the California Coast Ranges"
Jv,"Mafic and intermediate volcanic rocks, Coast Range ophiolite (Late and Middle Jurassic)",Great Valley Sequence,"Mostly massive basalt, also includes amygduloidal and plagioclase-porphyry basalt, pillow basalt, diabase, keratophyre, and amygduloidal and plagioclase-hornblende-porphyry andesite.  Coast Range ophiolite volcanic rocks are distinguished from Franciscan Complex volcanic rocks by lack of metamorphism and alteration, by association with intrusive rocks, and by lack of associated ribbon chert."
Jd,"Mafic and intermediate intrusive rocks, Coast Range ophiolite (Late and Middle Jurassic)",Great Valley Sequence,"Diabase, gabbro, and diorite.  Also includes minor intrusive keratophyre.  The Franciscan Complex terranes contain very few outcrops of intrusive rocks, especially plutonic rocks like gabbro and diorite, so presence of this unit is indicative of Coast Range ophiolite affinity"

Only large lenses are mapped.  In the eastern part of the Warm Springs Dam quadrangle, serpentinite, greenstone, and blueschist are tightly interleaved at outcrop scale"
Tsm,Sandstone and mudstone of the Fort Ross area (early Miocene),,"Gray-white, K-feldspar-bearing arkose overlain by black, somewhat fissile clayey siltstone.  The sandstone is interbedded with black mudstone. The siltstone contains thin beds and laminae of fine-grained sandstone and has yielded fish scales and early Miocene (Saucesian) foraminifers (Wentworth, 1967)"
Tg,German Rancho Formation of Wentworth and others (1998b) (Eocene and Paleocene),Great Valley Sequence,"Distinctly bedded, fine- to medium-grained, K-feldspar-bearing feldspathic arenite, mudstone, and conglomerate.  Coarse clasts consist mostly of granitic rocks, amphibolite, schist, gneiss, quartzite, and porphyry volcanics.  Eocene and Paleocene fossils have been collected from many places in the unit (for a recent discussion, see Wentworth and others, 1998b; Elder and others, 1998; McDougall, 1998), although the Paleocene section occurs only south of Black Point.  North of Black Point, the base of the unit is marked by red and green mudstone yielding early Eocene microfossils (Wentworth and others, 1998b; McDougall, 1998) and the Paleocene section is missing. This absence is attributed by Wentworth and others (1998b) to attenuation faulting"
TKu,Undifferentiated German Rancho and Gualala Formations (Eocene to Late Cretaceous),Great Valley Sequence,"Because of poor exposure, fault offset, lack of fossil age control, and similarity of lithologies, it has not been possible to differentiate between these two formations in a fault bounded sliver just west of the San Andreas Fault Zone (Stewarts Point, Annapolis, and Plantation quadrangles).  Outcrops of this unit are primarily deeply weathered arkose"
Ka,"Anchor Bay member, Gualala Formation of Wentworth and others (1998b) (Late Cretaceous and Paleocene?)",Great Valley Sequence,"Greenish-gray, fine- to medium-grained, plagioclase-bearing feldspathic arenite and mafic-clast pebble to boulder conglomerate.  Laumontite veins are found throughout the sandstone.  Coarse clasts include mostly basalt, diabase, gabbro, diorite, quartz diorite, and andesite, although pyroxenite is locally present in boulder conglomerate.  Molluscan fossils of Late Cretaceous age have been found throughout the member (Elder and others, 1998), but foraminifers of Late Cretaceous to late Paleocene age have been found in the same section, interleaved both with each other and with Late Cretaceous molluscan fossils (Wentworth and others, 1998b; McDougall, 1998).  This apparent conflict is still unresolved"
Ks,"Stewarts Point member, Gualala Formation of Wentworth and others (1998b) (Late Cretaceous and Paleocene?)",Great Valley Sequence,"Gray, fine- to medium-grained, K-feldspar and plagioclase-bearing feldspathic arenite and conglomerate.  Coarse clasts include porphyry volcanics and granitic rocks.  This unit has yielded Late Cretaceous (late Campanian or younger) molluscan fossils and foraminifers (Wentworth and others, 1998b; McDougall, 1998; Elder and others, 1998)"
KJsb,Spilite near Black Point of Wentworth and others (1998b) (Cretaceous? or Jurassic?),Great Valley Sequence,"Massive to pillowed basalt flows and sheeted diabase sills, metamorphosed to low-grade greenschist facies (albite-chlorite- clinozoisite; Phillips and others, 1998).  Wentworth and others (1998b) correlate this unit with the Coast Range ophiolite, but the geochemical studies of Phillips and others (1998) suggest a back-arc magmatic affinity, which differs from the Coast Range ophiolite (fore-arc affinity).  Jachens and others (1998) correlate the positive magnetic anomaly related to this unit with that related to the Logan gabbro in San Mateo County to the south (offset by the San Andreas/San Gregorio Fault Zone), but there is no unequivocal match between any strata in the area underlain by Logan gabbro and strata underlain by this unit.  This unit was originally assigned to the Cretaceous (Wentworth, 1967), but no direct evidence is available and both correlated mafic bodies are Jurassic (James and others, 1993; Blake and others, 1992; Hagstrum, 1997; Hopson and others, 1997)"
