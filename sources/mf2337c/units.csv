Metagraywacke and minor slaty interbeds are similar to sandstone and shale of Kfs, Kfgwy, and fsr in color and bedding character, although bedding is commonly obscure. Rock is fractured and variably sheared, locally severely; tectonic inclusions, particularly of coarse-grained metamorphics and serpentinite, are common where unit is severely sheared. Severely sheared rock and metagraywacke that yields vermiculite on weathering form relatively subdued topography, whereas metagreenstone generally forms rugged mountains. Good exposures of these rocks occur in roadcuts along northeast side of Stafford Lake (west of Novato in the northeast corner of the San Geronimo quadrangle)"

sp,Serpentinite (Jurassic),Franciscan Complex,,"Including relatively fresh ultramafic rock; crops out as lenses and irregularly shaped masses, largely within and along boundaries of fsr; most serpentinite displays a prominent shear fabric."
sc,Silica-carbonate rock (Jurassic),Franciscan Complex,,"Hard, tough rock that crops out mostly along margins of serpentinite bodies and as small discrete masses in severely sheared mélange locally contains minor cinnabar. Some parts of the rock may be Tertiary in age."
fsr,Mélange,Franciscan Complex,,"A tectonic mixture of variably sheared shale and sandstone containing (1) hard tectonic inclusions largely of greenstone, chert, graywacke, and their metamorphosed equivalents, plus exotic high-grade metamorphic rocks and serpentinite and (2) variably resistant masses of graywacke, greenstone, and serpentinite up to several miles in longest dimension, and including minor discrete masses of limestone too small to be shown. Blocks and resistant masses have survived the extensive shearing evident in the mélange's matrix, and range in abundance from less than 1 to 50 percent or more of the rock mass. The degree of shearing in the unit ranges from gouge to unsheared rock, with resistant masses relatively unsheared and matrix sheared. Severely sheared shale is abundant in areas where blocks are abundant. Fresh, relatively unsheared rock is hard, the larger resistant masses are pervasively fractured, and blocks are commonly tough and relatively unfractured. Sandstone is graywacke, grayish green where fresh, weathering to brown, commonly medium to coarse grained, containing abundant angular lithic grains and no detrital potassium feldspar, except rarely as much as 5 percent. Graywacke is locally veined with quartz and carbonate, and usually contains microscopic secondary pumpellyite. Topography of coherent masses resembles that of unit Kfs, whereas highly sheared matrix typically yields subdued, gently-rounded topography. Good exposures of both sheared matrix and relatively unsheared graywacke and shale occur at the crushed rock quarry just east of the intersection of State Highway 17 and U.S. Highway 101, in Greenbrae (Novato quadrangle)"
