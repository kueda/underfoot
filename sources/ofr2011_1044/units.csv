ml,,Modified land or artificial fill (latest Holocene),"Natural or man-made materials emplaced for various purposes, including construction, agriculture, flood control, and mining. Also includes areas where surface sediments have been removed by grading or quarrying. Modified land typically alters patterns and rates of drainage, infiltration, soil erosion, and soil development. Sedimentary structures, surface morphology, and soils inherited from original deposit typically are altered or destroyed. Often visible on aerial photographs as simple geometric patterns and areas of consistent albedo, for example linear dark strips for roads and bright circles for crop patches. Vegetation is typically sparse and dominated by first-succession species",
Qaa,,Active alluvial fan deposits (latest Holocene),"Poorly to moderately sorted fine sand to boulders deposited by ephemeral streams that actively receive or have received sediments within the last few years or decades. Typically unconsolidated and uncemented, thus easily eroded. Surface undulates with rounded microtopography common to braided streams and pronounced bar and swale topography; incised channels are shallow or absent. Active fan channels originate from the mountain front, incised in the proximal fan and tending to diffuse in the distal fan; distinct from active washes (Qaw), which generally occur at the base of fans and trend parallel to the mountain front. Soil development is minimal but fine grained eolian sediment may be abundant, especially in distal piedmont areas. Surfaces are prone to flooding. Main proximal fan channels are sharply defined on aerial photographs as long, bright, sinuous features and grade down-fan into complex braided-channel networks. Vegetation typically reflects age of exposure, with recently active surfaces having sparse annuals, and older surfaces supporting a patchwork of shrubs such as creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) and white bursage (Ambrosia dumosa) on surfaces active only decadally",

Qyad,,Young alluvial fan debris-flow deposits (Holocene and latest Pleistocene),"Muddy sand containing scattered pebbles, cobbles, and boulders; poorly sorted and poorly stratified. Mainly deposited by debris flows, but large-volume deposits may grade laterally or vertically into weakly stratified, moderately sorted hyperconcentrated stream deposits.

Surface broadly undulating, gently rounding downward into active alluvial deposits that form low to moderately dense channel networks cutting the surface.
