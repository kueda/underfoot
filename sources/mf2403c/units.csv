ac,Artificial channel deposits (Historic),"Modified stream channels, usually where streams have been straightened and realigned. Deposits in artificial channels range from concrete in lined channels to sand and gravel similar to natural stream channel deposits (Qhc )",
ads,Dredge spoils (Historic),"This unit, mapped and described by Atwater (1982), consists of sand, locally laminated, and subordinate silt, clay, and peat that have been deposited as hydraulic dredge spoils during attempts to widen, straighten, and (or) deepen the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. The large body of sand near the Montezuma Hills was probably emplaced between 1908 and 1941 (Atwater, 1982). This unit is mapped only in a few quadrangles within the San Joaquin/Sacramento Delta",
af,Artificial fill (Historic),"Undifferentiated man-made deposit of various materials and ages, including some dredge spoils, levee fill, and fill over Bay mud and also road embankments, earthen dams, and railroad grades. Some are compacted and quite firm, but fills made before 1965 are nearly everywhere not compacted and consist simply of dumped materials. Much of this unit is mapped based on topographic expression on the most recent USGS 7.5 minute quadrangles of the map area",
afbm,Artificial fill over bay mud (Historic),Artificial fill placed in the estuarine environment to create new land,
alf,Artificial levee fill (Historic),"Man made deposit of various materials and ages, forming artificial levees as much as 20 ft (6.5 m) high. Some are compacted and quite firm, but fills made before 1965 are almost everywhere not compacted and consist simply of dumped materials. Levees bordering waterways of the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta, mudflats, and large streams were first emplaced as much as 150 years ago. The distribution of levee fill conforms to levees shown on the most recent U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute quadrangle maps",

Qds,Dune sands (early Holocene and latest Pleistocene),"Very well sorted fine- to medium-grained eolian sand. They occur mainly in two large northwest-southeast trending sheets, as well as many small hills, most displaying Barchan morphology. Dunes display as much as 30 m of erosional relief and are presently being buried by basin deposits (Qhb ) and delta mud (Qhdm ). They probably began accumulating after the last interglacial high stand of sea-level began to recede about 79 ka (Imbrie and others, 1984; Martinson and others, 1987; Hendy and Kennett, 2000), continued to form when sea level dropped to its Wisconsin minimum about 18 ka, and probably ceased to accumulate after sea level reached its present elevation (about 6 ka). Atwater (1982) recognized buried paleosols in the dunes, indicating periods of nondeposition",
Qpa,Alluvium (late Pleistocene),"Poorly to moderately sorted sand, silt, and gravel in the Capay area (Esparto quadrangle).

Contains angular to well-rounded clasts including varicolored chert, graywacke, metagraywacke, greenstone, and glaucophane schist predominantly derived from rocks of the Franciscan Complex. South of the map area this unit contains terrestrial mammal fossils of late Miocene (Clarendonian) age (Merriam, 1913)",

Contains moderately rounded to well- rounded pebbles and cobbles of laminated brown and gray chert and porcellanite probably derived from the Claremont chert which crops out south of the map area, as well as varicolored chert, andesite, greenstone, graywacke, blueschist, and pumice. Just south of the map area this unit includes a tuff bed correlated with the informally named Roblar tuff of Sarna-Wojcicki (1992), which has yielded radiometric ages around 6 Ma (Sarna-Wojckici, 1976). The lithology, clast composititon, and the presence of Roblar tuff suggest that this unit is, at least in part, correlative with the Petaluma Formation (Tps) in the Sears Point area. These two units have probably been offset about 35 km from their original contiguous depositional position in the past 6 m.y. by movement on the Hayward-Rodgers Creek-Healdsburg Fault Zone",
Tut,Tuffaceous sandstone (late Miocene),"Tuffaceous sandstone containing pumice fragments. Originally mapped as Pinole Tuff, this unit is now thought to underlie the Roblar tuff of Sarna-Wojcicki (1992), which is now known to be older than the Pinole Tuff (Tpt )",

Tsr,San Ramon Sandstone (early Miocene and (or) Oligocene),"Bluish-gray to brown, medium-grained sandstone with conglomerate locally present in basal part. The accepted age for this unit was early Miocene, based on Addicott (1970) who noted that Weaver and others (1944) had reclassified the molluscan zone of the San Ramon Sandstone fauna (Echinophoria apta) from late Oligocene to early Miocene. However, Kleinpell (1938) reported early Zemorrian foraminifers from the San Ramon Sandstone. Weaver and others (1944) classified the Zemorrian as early Miocene (probably based on the relationships in this unit), but more recent work on foraminiferal zonation by McDougall (1983) has shown the Zemorrian zone to be entirely Oligocene. In addition, the San Ramon Sandstone south of the map area underlies tuffaceous sandstone and tuff correlated with the Kirker Tuff, which is considered to be Oligocene. The contradiction in accepted ages of the two units and the contradiction of foraminiferal and molluscan zonation has caused Graymer (2000) to use the less restricted age indicated",

The unit also includes minor siltstone, more common near the top, and conglomerate near the base. In Monticello Dam quadrangle, the basal part also includes a layer of megabreccia, angular blocks of sandstone and siltstone up to 3.5 m in length in a conglomeratic mudstone matrix (see Peterson, 1965; Lowe, 1972). This unit contains sparse foraminifers of Late Cretaceous (Turonian) age (Goudkoff, 1945; Lachenbruch, 1962; Emerson and Roberts, 1962; Sonneman and Switzer, unpub. data, 1961- 1962; Almgren, unpub. data, 2002)",Great Valley Complex
KJu,Sandstone (Early Cretaceous and Late Jurassic),Ridge-forming section as much as 350 m thick of massive to thick-bedded lithic wacke,Great Valley Complex
KJgvm,Mélange (Early Cretaceous and Late Jurassic),Southwest of Lake Berryessa lies a fault-bounded zone of highly to moderately sheared and disrupted sandstone and shale identical to unit KJgv. The deformation ranges from small scale isoclinal folds to formation of slaty cleavage in the shale and complete disruption of the sandstone. Quartz and calcite veins are common. Large lenses of basalt breccia (Jv ) are intercalated into the unit. This unit has either undergone repeated imbrication along reverse or thrust faults that have tectonically interleaved the sedimentary rocks with the previously underlying volcanics or formed as an olistostrome from volcanic-bearing submarine debris flows and has undergone considerable later deformation,Great Valley Complex
Jk,Knoxville Formation (Late Jurassic),"Only differentiated in the Mt. George quadrangle, this unit is made up of distinctly bedded black shale and thin beds of biotite-lithic wacke and contains only Late Jurassic fossils",Great Valley Complex
Jv,Basalt and keratophyre (Jurassic),"Mostly massive black basalt, also includes amygdaloidal and plagioclase- porphyry basalt, pillow basalt, basalt breccia, diabase, and keratophyre. Coast Range ophiolite volcanic rocks are distinguished from Franciscan complex volcanic rocks by lack of metamorphism and alteration, by association with intrusive rocks, and by lack of associated ribbon chert",Great Valley Complex
Kfs,Sandstone (Late Cretaceous),"Sandstone and interbedded shale, with minor conglomerate. This unit crops out in alternating sequences of largely medium thick to very thick sandstone beds with generally minor interbedded shale and predominantly shale with interbedded thin to medium-thick sandstone beds. The rock is locally severely sheared or brecciated but lacks tectonic inclusions of other rock types such as greenstone and chert which are common in unit fsr. The sandstone is light gray where fresh, weathering to buff colors, and shale is commonly dark gray. Laumontite veins, calcite veins, and microscopic secondary prehnite and (or) pumpellyite are common in sandstone. Rocks of this unit typically form resistant topography",Franciscan Complex
KJfm,Metagraywacke (Early Cretaceous and Late Jurassic),"Brown-weathering, gray, foliated (textural zone 2A of Jayko and others, 1986), jadeite-bearing metagraywacke. Similar jadeite-bearing metagraywacke elsewhere in the Coast Ranges has yielded radiometric metamorphic ages of 90-110 Ma (Wakabayashi, 1999; Mattinson and Echevarria, 1980) and has yielded Late Jurassic (Tithonian) fossils (Crawford, 1976)",Franciscan Complex
fsr,Mélange,"Sheared argillite and graywacke matrix enclosing blocks and lenses of graywacke, chert, metachert, greenstone, serpentinite, silica-carbonate rock, blueschist (metasediment and metabasalt), eclogite, amphibolite, limestone, and quartz-mica schist. Enclosed blocks and lenses range in size from pebbles to slabs several hundred meters across. The matrix graywacke has yielded Late Jurassic (Tithonian) fossils northwest of the map area (Bailey and others, 1964). High-grade blocks northwest of the map area have yielded metamorphic ages of about 138-150 Ma (K/Ar, Kelley, 1982; Lee and others, 1964). Chert blocks in Marin County west of the map area almost all similar to coherent chert of the Marin Headlands terrane (Murchey and Jones, 1984). Mélange blocks are probably derived from tectonic detachment of pieces of surrounding coherent Franciscan Complex and Great Valley complex terranes",Franciscan Complex
