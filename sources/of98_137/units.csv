af,Artificial fill (Historic),,"Loose to very well consolidated gravel, sand, silt, clay, rock fragments, organic matter, and man-made debris in various combinations.  Thickness is variable and may exceed 30 m in places. Some is  compacted and quite firm, but fill made before 1965 is nearly everywhere not compacted and consists simply of dumped materials"
alf,Artificial levee fill (Historic),,"Man-made deposit of various materials and ages, forming artificial levees as much as 6.5 m high.  Some are compacted and quite firm, but fills made before 1965 are almost everywhere not compacted and consist simply of dumped materials.

Qhasc,Artificial stream channels (Historic),,"Modified stream channels, in most places where streams have been straightened and realigned"
Qhsc,Stream channel deposits (Holocene),,"Poorly to well-sorted sand, silt, silty sand, or sandy gravel with minor cobbles.  Cobbles are more common in the mountainous valleys.  Many stream channels are presently lined with concrete or rip rap.  Engineering works such as diversion dams, drop structures, energy dissipaters and percolation ponds also modify the original channel.  Many stream channels have been straightened, and these are labeled Qhasc.  This straightening is especially prevalent in the lower reaches of streams entering the estuary.  The mapped distribution of stream channel deposits is controlled by the depiction of major creeks on the most recent U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute quadrangles.  Only those deposits related to major creeks are mapped. In some places these deposits are under shallow water for some or all of the year, as a result of reservoir release and annual variation in rainfall."
Qhbd,Beach deposits (Holocene),,"Loose clastic deposits composed of sand- to cobble-size fragments in the bay tidal zone.  Moderately well-sorted by wave action.  Near Little Coyote Point, deposits are composed mostly of oyster shell fragments; west of Coyote Point deposits are composed mostly of rock debris derived from artificial fill (af)"

The mud also contains a few lenses of well-sorted, fine sand and silt, a few shelly layers (oysters), and peat. The mud interfingers with and grades into fine-grained deposits at the distal edge of Holocene fans, and was deposited during the post-Wisconsin rise in sea-level, about 12 ka to present (Imbrie and others, 1984).

These deposits display variable sorting and are located along most stream channels  in the county.  All Qpaf deposits can be related to modern stream courses.
