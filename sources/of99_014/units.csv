QTp,,Paso Robles Formation valley deposits (Pliocene and Pleistocene),"Dissected locally deformed valley deposits in upper Salinas Valley were named the Paso Robles Formation by Fairbanks (1898, p. 565-566) for exposures near Paso Robles (fig. 1). This name has since been applied to these deposits beyond the Paso Robles area by Fairbanks (1904), Arnold and Johnson (1910, pi. 1), Bramlette and Daviess (1944), Dibblee (1962, p. 6-10, pi. 1), and Durham (1963, 1964, 1966) and is used herein.

In the Salinas Valley lowland area north of the La Panza Range, the Paso Robles Formation is as much as 1,500 feet in exposed thickness; it attains a total maximum thickness of more than 4,000 feet in the subsurface west of Shandon as indicated from well logs. In this lowland area this valley deposit is composed of pebble gravel, sand, and clay, derived from the La Panza Range and from mountains west of Salinas Valley. In the subsurface near Shandon it conformably(?) overlies the unnamed Pliocene marine sediments (Pancho Rico(?) Formation) as indicated by well logs. In the La Panza Range and Red Hills, this valley deposit thins and unconformably laps over the previously deformed middle Tertiary sedimentary sequence onto the crystalline basement complex.

Under the Carrizo Pain, the Paso Robles Formation is as thick as 2,000 feet near the San Andreas fault as indicated from well logs, and is composed largely of shale-pebble gravel, sand, and clay, derived mainly from the Temblor Range. Southwestward this valley deposit thins and buttresses out against previously deformed Morales and Quatal Formations and the middle Tertiary sedimentary sequence of the Caliente Range.

At and near the southeast end of the Caliente Range and southwest of the San Andreas fault, the Paso Robles Formation (""deformed fanglomerate from eastern sources"" of Vedder and Repenning, 1965, and ""deformed alluvial deposits"" of Vedder, 1970) is as thick as 1,000 feet and is unconformable on previously deformed lower, middle, and upper Tertiary sequences, including the Morales Formation. The Paso Robles Formation is there composed of gravel and some landslide debris of rocks exposed in the San Emigdio Mountains across the fault, but now is some 20 miles southeast of this area, owing to that much strike-slip on the fault since deposition of this detritus.

Northeast of the San Andreas fault, the Paso Robles Formation is as thick as 2,000 feet and more adjacent to the fault, but thins out rapidly northeastward against the Temblor Range. It unconformably overlies rocks of the Temblor Range, including the Morales Formation, and was derived entirely from the Temblor Range.

In Cuyama Valley, equivalents of the Paso Robles Formation are thought to be the old dissected locally deformed alluvial fan deposits, such as several on the southwest side of the Caliente Range and one southwest of New Cuyama. These deposits are as thick as 600 feet and are composed of coarse locally derived detritus.

The top of the Paso Robles Formation, where preserved from erosion, is a surface of deposition, or an old valley surface that was never buried. Carrizo Plain, where it is preserved under a thin cover of alluvium, is a remnant of this former very extensive valley surface of deposition. To the northwest and west this old valley surface becomes increasingly dissected and largely destroyed by down-cutting stream channels of the present Salinas River drainage system. Along its margins this old valley surface of deposition blends into the old erosion surface of the La Panza, Caliente, and Temblor Ranges as the Paso Robles Formation thins out against those previously elevated areas.

The age of the Paso Robles Formation can only be inferred from its stratigraphic position and from geomorphic relations because, except in one place, no diagnostic fossils have been found. This formation has been variously inferred to be Pliocene, Pleistocene, or Pliocene and Pleistocene in age. Durham (1966, p. B22) and Galehouse (1967, p. 955-956) considered it to be Pliocene and possibly Pleistocene in age because of the apparent inter-tonguing relationship with the underlying marine Pancho Rico Formation (lower Pliocene) east and southeast of King City. In that part of Salinas Valley (northwest of fig. 2), however, the Paso Robles Formation is thin, and some of the lower beds into which marine beds intertongue may be equivalent to the Morales or Quatal Formations farther south-east.

The Paso Robles Formation must be at least in part of Pleistocene age because its top surface of deposition, which blends into the Pleistocene erosion surface of the adjacent mountains where this surface is cut on units as young as the Morales Formation, is in large part preserved, whereas no surface of deposition of any Tertiary formation remains unburied and uneroded. The angular unconformable relationship of the Paso Robles Formation to all older units, including the Morales Formation of late Pliocene age, suggests that all the Paso Robles Formation in areas in which this relationship exists is of Pleistocene age.

The single locality in which fossils were found in the Paso Robles Formation is 2 miles east of Atascadero in a roadcut about 300 feet west of middle of west line of sec.7, T, 28 S., R. 13 E. At that place, brackish-marine mollusks were found (by J. S. Galehouse) in shale-pebble gravel about 20 feet above the base of the Paso Robles Formation. W. O. Addicott (written commun., 1971) considered them probably Pliocene, possibly middle Pliocene. Also found at this locality, and in basal cobble gravel of this formation within 3 miles south-east of Santa Margarita, are cobbles with mollusk-bored holes.

Although the Paso Robles Formation is generally regarded as Pliocene and Pleistocene (?) in age, the formation within the area of figure 2 is considered by the writer to be of Pleistocene age and in places partly of probable late Pliocene age because of the stratigraphic relations and fossil data as indicated.

QTt,,Tulare Formation valley deposits (Pliocene and Pleistocene),"Locally deformed dissected valley deposits composed of gravel, sand, and silt in the hills on the southwest side of the San Joaquin Valley near Coalinga were named Tulare Formation by Anderson (1905, p. 181) for nearby Tulare Lake. No type locality was then designated, but Woodring, Stewart, and Richards (1940, p. 13) suggested the exposures on the northeast flank of the northern part of Kettleman Hills North Dome as the type section. The name Paso Robles Formation was also applied to these valley deposits by Anderson and Pack (1915, pi. 1) and to those in the Temblor Range by Pack (1920, pi. II, p. 47-52). These deposits in the Temblor Range, however, were included earlier by Arnold and Johnson (1910, pi. 1) in a unit they named McKittrick Formation. These valley sediments were redesignated the Tulare Formation by Woodring, Roundy, and Farnsworth (1932, p. 16- 30), Dibblee (1962, p. 8-10, pi. 1), and Foss and Blaisdell (1968 p. 35) because, even though they are lithologically similar to and occupy the same stratigraphic position as does the Paso Robles Formation, they were deposited in a different basin or valley. This usage is retained herein.

In the foothills of the Diablo Range and in the Kettleman Hills, the Tulare Formation is about 2,700 feet thick and grades downward into the San Joaquin Formation. Well data in the subsurface of the Elk Hills, Buena Vista Hills, and east of the Temblor Range indicate that it is similar. In the foothills of the Temblor Range it thins out westward against the unconformably underlying Etchegoin Formation and Monterey Shale. The top of the Tulare Formation is a valley surface of deposition that forms the present undissected surface of San Joaquin Valley under a thin mantle of alluvium but is severely dissected, though partly preserved, where it is elevated by deformation in the Elk Hills, Buena Vista Hills (east of Taft), and foothills of the Temblor Range.

The age of the Tulare Formation is inferred to be late Pliocene and Pleistocene (Arnold and Anderson, 1910, p. 140, 154; Pack, 1920, pi. II; Woodring and others, 1932, p. 27, and 1940, p. 104; Stewart, 1946, p. 105; Wahrhaftig and Birman, 1965, p. 314-316) or Pleistocene (Goudkoff, 1943, p. 248-249; McMasters, 1947, fig. 34; Foss and Blaisdell, 1968, p. 35). A few mammalian fossils found in the San Joaquin Formation just below the base of the Tulare Formation in the Kettleman Hills and near McKittrick are diagnostic of the Blancair age, late Pliocene or Pleistocene (C. A. Repenning, oral commun., 1968). On the basis of diatom studies, the Tulare Formation is considered to be of Pliocene and Pleistocene age (K. E. Lohman, written commun., 1968).

The Tulare Formation within the area of figure 2 is probably correlative with most of if not all the Paso Robles Formation on the basis of its similar lithology, stratigraphic position, and geomorphic relations and is likewise tentatively assigned a late Pliocene(?) and Pleistocene age.

QTu,,Unnamed valley deposits (Pliocene and Pleistocene),
Tmo,,Morales Formation valley sediments (Pliocene),"In the Cuyama Valley, Caliente Range, and in the area northwest of Carrizo Plain is exposed a deformed valley deposit, as much as 5,000 feet thick, of light-gray gravel, sand, and silt that conformably overlies the Quatal Formation and unconformably laps onto the middle Tertiary sedimentary sequence. This valley deposit was named the Morales Member of the Santa Margarita Formation by English (1916, p. 203, pi. XIX) for Morales Canyon (10 miles north- west of New Cuyama), the type locality. This deposit was redefined as a formation by Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958, p. 2990, 2996-2998) because it differs lithologically from the Santa Margarita Formation and in the type locality in unconformably overlies the Santa Margarita Formation with angular discordance. The usage of Morales Formation of Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958) and Vedder (1970) is retained herein.

The Morales Formation was inferred to be of Pliocene age by Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958, p. 2996-2998) on the basis of its stratigraphic position above the Quatal Formation and Miocene strata and because of its unconformable relationship below equivalents of the Paso Robles Formation in western Cuyama Valley and eastern Caliente Range and at San Juan Creek northwest of Carrizo Plain.

A tooth of Equus (Pleisohippus) sp. (large horse), considered diagnostic of Blancan age (Pliocene or Pleistocene) of the vertebrate chronology, was found near the middle of the 5,000-foot-thick Morales Formation in the eastern Caliente Range (Vedder and Repenning, 1965; Vedder, 1970). The profound deformation of this formation, however, as compared to the much less deformed unconformably overlying Paso Robles Formation indicates that the Morales Formation probably is late Pliocene in age, to which it was assigned by Vedder (1970).

In the Panorama Hills and southwestern foothills of the Temblor Range just northeast of the San Andreas fault, as much as 2,500 feet of terrestrial gravel named Panorama Hills Formation by Dibblee (1962, p. 8, pi. 1) gradationally overlies sandstone of the unnamed marine sediments and is unconformably overlain by the Paso Robles Formation. The name Panorama Hills Formation is herein abandoned, and this unit is assigned to the Morales Formation because it is of similar lithology and is probably in large part correlative. Presumably this valley deposit accumulated in the same basin as the Morales Formation now exposed in the Caliente Range and Cuyama Valley.

Tsj,,"San Joaquin Formation, mostly mudstone (Pliocene)","In the Kettleman Hills the San Joaquin Formation, as mapped by Woodring, Stewart, and Richards (1940, p. 26-28, pi. 1), is from 1,200 to 1,800 feet thick and is mainly gray soft claystone, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone. The base was taken as the base of a 50-foot-thick bed of gray to blue sandstone and pebble conglomerate (Cascajo Conglomerate Member of Woodring and others, 1940, p. 49-53). The San Joaquin Formation overlies the Etchegoin Formation and grades upward into the Tulare Formation. The type locality of the San Joaquin Formation is on the northeast flank of Ket- tleman Hills, in sec. 23, T. 22 S., R. 18 E., 8 miles east of Avenal (fig. 1), as suggested by Barbat and Galloway (1934, p. 478-480); however, Woodring, Stewart, and Richards (1940, p. 27) suggested a better standard section 3 miles northwest in sec. 8, T. 22 S., R. 18 E.

In the foothills north of Reef Ridge, the San Joaquin Formation is about 2,000 feet thick and is similar to its exposure in Kettleman Hills. The base is taken as a thin pebble bed that overlies blue sandstone of the Etchegoin Formation. The San Joaquin Formation grades upward into the Tulare Formation through interbeds of conglomerate similar to that of the Tulare Formation. Southeastward along strike, the contact with the Tulare Formation becomes difficult to map because the upper 1,200 feet of the San Joaquin Formation contains increasing amounts of sandstone and many layers of shale-pebble conglomerate, a composition like that of the Tulare Formation.

The San Joaquin Formation in the Kettleman Hills contains marine, brackish-water, and lacustrine fossils considered to be of late Pliocene age by Woodring, Stewart, and Richards (1940, p. 103). They reported (1940, p. 97-98) mammalian fossils from the ""Pecten zone"" about 600 feet below the top of this unit. These were considered by Durham, Jahns, and Savage (1954, p. 69) to be of Blancan age or late Pliocene and early Pleistocene age and by Hibbard, Ray, Savage, Taylor, and Guilday (1965, p. 512) to be early Blancan age or late Pliocene. Adegoke (1969, p. 51) suggested that part or all of the San Joaquin Formation may be of Pleistocene age. In the Reef Ridge foothills the San Joaquin Formation contains molluscan fossils that Addicott (oral commun., 1968) considered to be of late Pliocene age. The unit is tentatively assigned a late Pliocene age, but could range into the Pleistocene, depending on the interpretation of the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary.

Tq,,"Quatal Formation, terrestrial claystone and sandstone (Pliocene)","In the eastern Caliente Range, red beds of the Caliente Formation are overlain conformably by as much as 700 feet of lacustrine gray claystone. This claystone is believed to correlate, on the basis of similar lithology and stratigraphic position, with the Quatal Formation named by Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958, p. 2996-2997) for Quatal Canyon near the type locality, in the Cuyama badlands southeast of the Caliente Range and beyond the southeast border of figure 2. This name is herein adopted for this claystone in both exposures.

The Quatal Formation, which conformably underlies the terrestrial Morales Formation, is exposed at only a few places other than in the Caliente Range. In the Cuyama badlands it is composed of about 400 feet of reddish-brown claystone and gypsum that overlies the Caliente Formation. South of Cuyama Valley it is composed of 200-400 feet of white sandstone and red clay that disconformably overlies the Santa Margarita Formation and Branch Canyon Sandstone. In San Juan Creek, northwest of Carrizo Plain, about 200 feet of gray clay assigned to the Quatal Formation disconformably overlies the Santa Margarita Formation.

The Quatal Formation was presumed by Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958, p. 2996) to be of late Miocene age because of its stratigraphic position. In the Caliente Range the uppermost beds of the Caliente Formation that underlie the Quatal contain mammalian remains diagnostic of Hemphillian age, Pliocene (Savage, 1957, p. 1845), and beds about 1,600 feet above the base of the overlying Morales Formation contain a few mammalian remains of Blancan age (James, 1963, p. 11; Repenning and Vedder, 1961). The relationship of the Quatal Formation to the Pliocene(?) marine sediments of the Shandon area to the northwest is concealed, but the Quatal is presumably younger. Because of its stratigraphic position, the Quatal Formation is herein inferred to be of Hemphillian age and is assigned to the Pliocene.

Tu,,"Unnamed marine sediments, sandstone and siltstone (Pliocene)","Several test holes drilled for petroleum in the Shandon area of the Salinas Valley southwest of the San Andreas fault passed through as much as 2,000 feet of marine sandstone and siltstone of probable Pliocene age below the Paso Robles Formation and above the Santa Margarita Formation. Because of its comparable age and stratigraphic position, this unit may be equivalent to the Pancho Rico Formation, as redefined by Durham and Addicott (1964, p. E4; 1965, p. A2-A5) in Salinas Valley northwest of figure 2.

In the narrow strip on the northeast side of the San Andreas fault east of Soda Lake is exposed about 2,000 feet of marine sandstone that overlies conglomerate of the Santa Margarita Formation and grades laterally northward and upward into the terrestrial Morales Formation. The relationship of this sandstone to the Bitterwater Creek Shale is discussed under that formation. This marine sandstone unit contains early Pliocene mollusks (Arnold and Johnson, 1910, p. 89; W. 0. Addicott, oral commun., 1967). It may be correlative with the marine unit in the Shandon area described previously and also with part of the lithologically similar Etchegoin Formation of San Joaquin Valley and the Diablo Range.

Teb,,"Etchegoin Formation, blue sandstone (Pliocene)","The Etchegoin Formation, as redefined by Nomland (1917), Barbat and Galloway (1934), and Adegoke (1969, p. 26-28), is a series of semifriable sandstone and interbedded siltstone, claystone, and minor pebble conglomerate, all deposited under shallow-water marine conditions and presumably of Pliocene age. In a few places it contains thin strata of tuff. In the Reef Ridge it is about 5,200 feet thick, overlies the Reef Ridge Shale or the Monterey Shale, and is overlain by the San Joaquin Formation.

The type locality of the Etchegoin Formation has not been clearly designated. The formation was named by F. M. Anderson (1905) for ""its characteristic development in the vicinity of Etchegoin ranch"" (in T. 19 S., R. 15 E.) north of Coalinga. He did not designate a type section, but Arnold and Anderson (1910, p. 113) stated: ""The nearest locality to the Etchegoin ranch for which a description or section was given is 9 miles north of Coalinga, and this may therefore be taken as the type section."" But on their map (Arnold and Anderson, 1910, pi. 1) this ""locality"" plots several miles west of what they mapped as the Etchegoin Formation. From this confusion it may be said that the type section is within T. 19 S., R. 15 E., north of Coalinga, but its exact designation will not be made until that; area, which is far north of the area of figure 2, is more carefully mapped.

The most complete and best exposed section, which is herein designated as the reference section, is that north of Reef Ridge between Big Tar and Garza Creeks, Garza Peak quadrangle, or from 3 to 5 miles southwest of Avenal (figs. 1, 2). The section there is about 5,200 feet thick and is conformable between the Reef Ridge Shale below and San Joaquin Formation above. In this section the Etchegoin Formation is composed of two parts, as recognized by Adegoke (1969, p. 28). The lower part (Basal Brown Sandstone Member of Adegoke, 1969, p. 28), about 3,500 feet thick, is mainly bedded commonly nodular brownish-gray sandstone and interbedded siltstone in about equal amounts and contains few fossils. This unit corresponds roughly to the unit formerly called Jacalitos Formation by earlier workers (fig. 13). The upper part (Upper Blue Sandstone Member of Adegoke, 1969, p. 28), about 1,700 feet thick, is similar to the lower part; however, sandstones predominate and are somewhat coarser and commonly pebbly and (or) fossiliferous, and many of them are blue. This unit corresponds roughly to the formerly restricted Etchegoin Formation of Stewart (1946, p. 105, pi. 9). It is similar to and nearly equivalent to the ""blue bed fades"" mapped farther northwest by Rose and Colburn (1963, p. 33). Other places where this unit is exposed are in McLure Valley and Kettleman Hills.

On the geologic map (Dibblee, 1973b) only parts of the Upper Blue Sandstone Member of Adegoke (1969, p. 28) that are composed predominantly of blue sandstone are mapped separately from the rest of the Etchegoin Formation (fig. 14). In the Reef Ridge area there are several blue sandstone units, some as thick as 500 feet. Southeastward along strike all thin out or lose their distinctive blue color east of the Pyramid Hills. In McLure Valley the whole upper part of the Etchegoin Formation is composed of unfossiliferous massive blue sandstone, about 1,500 feet thick. In the Kettleman Hills (North and Middle Domes) several thin blue sandstone strata are present.

The blue sandstones are medium grained and commonly contain pebbles of black and variegated chert and andesite. The blue color of the sandstone is the effect of a thin blue coating on the grains.

The Etchegoin Formation of the Reef Ridge and Kettleman Hills areas contains abundant marine mollusks and echinoids of Pliocene age (Woodring and others, 1940, p. 102-103). In the Kettleman Hills (North Dome) and at a locality 10-12 miles north of Coalinga, a few mammalian remains from the upper part of the Etchegoin Formation are assigned to the late Hemphillian age, Pliocene (D. E. Savage, written commun. to C. A. Repenning, 1968). In the Reef Ridge area, the few molluscan fossils from the lower part of the Etchegoin Formation are considered to be early Pliocene, and those from the upper part are considered to be late Pliocene (W. O. Addicott, oral commun., 1969).

Trr,,Reef Ridge Shale (Miocene),"In the Reef Ridge and McLure Valley areas, about 500 feet of soft-weathering claystone is exposed that is transitional between the underlying Monterey Shale and overlying Etchegoin Formation.

It was described and named the Reef Ridge Shale by Barbat and Johnson, 1933, p. 239; 1934, p. 1-17) and by Gester and Galloway (1933, p. 1174-1176). This usage was adopted by Woodring, Stewart, and Richards (1940, p. 119-122) and Stewart (1946, p. 104, pi. 9) and is retained herein. This unit is arbitrarily placed at the top of the middle Tertiary sedimentary sequence. No type locality was designated, but Barbat and Johnson (1933, p. 4-5) stated that this shale unit is ""typically exposed"" from Little Tar Creek (9 miles south-southeast of Avenal) northwest for 22 miles to Jasper Creek (15 miles west of Avenal). They assigned this shale unit to the uppermost Miocene. The type locality is herein designated as the exposure in Big Tar Creek (about 5 miles south-southwest of Avenal) in sees. 7, 8, and 17, T. 23 S., R. 17 E., where the Reef Ridge Shale is about 550 feet thick.

According to Kleinpell (1938, p. 165), the Reef Ridge Shale contains foraminifers assigned to his Delmontian Stage, of latest Miocene age. His Delmontian Stage is, however, now considered to be part of, and inseparable from, his Mohnian Stage (R. L. Pierce, oral commun., 1970). Therefore, the Reef Ridge Shale of the type area is considered by Pierce to be of late Miocene age (Mohnian Stage). This age assignment, however, has not yet been doubtlessly ascertained, as it may range into early Pliocene.

Clay shale correlative with the Reef Ridge Shale does not crop out in the Temblor Range. Under the alluviated area to the east, however, wells penetrate between the Etchegoin Formation and Monterey Shale a shale unit from 150 to 900 feet thick that is referred to the Reef Ridge Shale by petroleum geologists. This shale unit was considered to be late Miocene and possibly early Pliocene in age and correlated with both the Reef Ridge Shale of Reef Ridge and the Belridge Diatomite Member of the Monterey Shale in the Temblor Range (Foss and Blaisdell, 1960, p. 36). Correlation with the Reef Ridge Shale is probably valid because of its similar stratigraphic position and because in some wells, such as in the Elk Hills oil field, this unit is gray clay shale (J. C. Maher, oral commun., 1970) similar to the Reef Ridge Shale of Reef Ridge. Correlation with the Belridge Diatomite Member is considered not valid, as the Reef Ridge Shale is thought to be younger than that unit because of reasons as indicated in the discussion of the Belridge Diatomite Member. Accordingly, then, the Reef Ridge Shale is probably correlative with the Bitterwater Creek Shale in the south end of the Temblor Range and is considered to be late Miocene and possibly early Pliocene in age.

Tbw,,Bitterwater Creek Shale (Mohnian Shale; Miocene),"Marine siliceous shale or mudstone that disconformably(?) overlies conglomerate of the Santa Margarita Formation in the Elkhorn Hills area southwest of Maricopa on the northeast side of the San Andreas fault was named the Bitterwater Creek Shale (Dibblee, 1962, p. 8-11, pi. 1). It was named for Bitterwater Creek, 6 miles southwest of Maricopa, the type locality, where as much as 2,000 feet of this shale is exposed and is unconformably overlain by the Paso Robles Formation. This usage is adopted herein.

The Bitterwater Creek Shale was thought to be of Pliocene(?) age (Dibblee, 1962) because of its stratigraphic position as indicated; however, it contains foraminifers, fish scales, and diatoms diagnostic of the Mohnian Stage, late Miocene (R. L. Pierce, oral commun., 1967; Vedder, 1970). This age is the same as that of the Belridge Diatomite Member of the Monterey Shale, but the Bitterwater Creek Shale is stratigraphically higher (fig. 8).

The relationship of the Bitterwater Creek Shale to the unnamed Pliocene marine clastic sediments to the northwest, which were formerly included in the Bitterwater Creek Shale (Dibblee, 1962, pi. 1), is not clear because of insufficient exposures and structural complications. North of the Elkhorn Hills the Bitterwater Creek Shale intertongues northwestward into unfossiliferous sandstone with siliceous shale pebbles. This sandstone is similar to that of the unit mapped as unnamed marine sediment, of early Pliocene age. If the sandstones are the same, the Bitterwater Creek Shale is equivalent to at least the lower part of that unit. It is possible, however, that the Bitterwater Creek Shale and the unfossiliferous sandstone are overlapped by that unit and if so, are thus older. From the foregoing evidence the Bitterwater Creek Shale is considered to be late Miocene (Mohnian) and possibly early Pliocene in age.

Tmb,,"Beldridge Diatomite Member, Monterey Shale (Mohnian Stage; Miocene)","The Belridge Diatomite Member, designated here in as the uppermost member of the Monterey Shale, was named informally by Siegfus (1939, p. 29) and Young (1943, p. 523-524) for the South Belridge oil field (fig. 9). The type section is herein designated as the section exposed near the mouth of Chico Martinez Creek (SEi/4 sec. 2, T 29 S., R 20 E., fig. 10). This member corresponds to Monterey Shale units 10 and 11 (total exposed thickness 830 ft) of Woodring, Stewart, and Richards (1940, p. 125). It is composed of white-weathering soft fissile to punky diatomite that grades downward into the McLure Shale Member and is overlain unconformably by the Tulare Formation. At Bacon Hills, 2 miles north of the type section, and near Gould Hill, 2 miles southeast, this diatomite unit is overlain disconformably by the Etchegoin Formation.

In the foothills of the Temblor Range from McKittrick to Maricopa, the Belridge Diatomite Member is discontinuously exposed and is similar to the Belridge at Chico Martinez Creek. Just west of Taft, as much as 2,200 feet of this unit is exposed unconformably below the Tulare Formation.

The Beldridge Diatomite Member has been correlated with the Reef Ridge Shale and assigned a
Miocene and Pliocene age by Foss and Blaisdell (1968, p. 36-37). It is, however, lithologically unlike the Reef Ridge Shale near Reef Ridge. In the exposed sections, the Belridge Diatomite Member contains foraminifers and fish scales diagnostic only of the late Mohnian State, late Miocene (R. L. Pierce, oral commun., 1967).)

From field relations the Belridge Diatomite Member is considered to be older than the type Reef Ridge Shale because in the extreme southeastern Temblor Range the Santa Margarita Formation, which intertongues into the Belridge Diatomite Member, is overlain by the Bitterwater Creek Shale, which in turn is probably correlative with the type Reef Ridge Shale. If this is so, then the Belridge Diatomite Member may be correlative with the upper part of the McLure Shale Member of the McLure Valley-Reef Ridge area.

The relationship of the Belridge Diatomite Member exposed in the Temblor Range to the unexposed Reef Ridge Shale in the oil fields to the east is uncertain because the exposed Belridge Diatomite Member has not definitely been recognized in the oil field subsurface area. These units have been correlated on the basis of supposed similar stratigraphic position (Foss and Blaisdell, 1968, p. 36), even though they are different lithologically. Subsurface structural data suggest that the Belridge Diatomite Member correlates wtih the upper part (the Antelope Shale of drillers) of the McLure Shale Member in the subsurface and dips under the subsurface argillaceous(?) unit referred to the Reef Ridge Shale (H. C. Wagner, oral commun., 1970). If this is correct, the exposed Belridge Diatomite Member is older than the Reef Ridge Shale of the subsurface.

Because of the foregoing evidence, the Belridge Diatomite Member exposed in the Temblor Range is assigned to the late Mohnian Stage, late Miocene, and is considered to be older than the Reef Ridge Shale.

Tm,,"McClure Shale Member, Monterey Shale (mostly Mohnian Stage; Miocene)","The McLure Shale Member is composed of white-weathering dark-brown thin-bedded chalky to hard porcelaneous siliceous shale. The type locality, desig- nated by Henny (1930, p. 404, table 1), is in sec. 8 (not sec. 6), T. 24 S., R. 17 E., on the west side of McLure Valley, for which it was named. At that locality, this shale is 800 feet thick and is unconformable on the Panoche Formation. In the McLure Valley and Reef Ridge areas, this member ranges from 550 to 1,000 feet in thickness, thinning northward, and is unconformable on the Temblor and older formations. In the Reef Ridge area the McLure Shale Member locally contains a basal conglomerate and sandstone with serpentine clasts (Stewart, 1946, p. 98, 103-104; Adegoke, 1969, p. 20). On the southwest flank of the Diablo Range and in the northwestern part of the Temblor Range, the McCLure Shale Member thickens southeastward to about 5,000 feet and is conformable on the Devilwater Shale Member or unconformable on the Point of Rocks Sandstone or Panoche Formation where the Devilwater Shale Member and Temblor Formation are absent. In these areas the McLure Shale Member contains one or more lenses of sandstone (Polonio Sandstone Tongue in McLure Shale of Marsh, 1960, p. 32-33).

The reference section of the McLure Shale Member of the Monterey Shale is here designated at Chico Martinez Creek in sees. 10 and 11, T. 29 S., R. 20 E. (fig. 10), where it is completely exposed. There it conformably overlies the Devilwater Shale Member and grades upward into the Belridge Diatomite Member. In this section the McLure Shale Member is 4,930 feet thick and corresponds to Monterey Shale units 4-9 of Woodring, Stewart, and Richards (1940, p. 125). This siliceous shale member includes units informally called McDonald Shale, Antelope Shale, and Chico Martinez Chert Members (San Joaquin Geological Society, 1959, p. 13; Foss and Blaisdell, 1968, p. 37; Elliot and others (1968, p. 110-112). These terms are not adopted because all these units are composed of siliceous shale, and outside the Chico Martinez Creek area it is not possible to differentiate them on a lithologic basis with certainty on the surface. The lowest unit, the McDonald of local usage, is recognizable in the Elk Hills and other oil fields on the basis of electric log patterns and early Mohnian foraminifers (J. C. Maher, oral commun., 1970).

In the southeastern part of the Temblor Range, the McLure Shale Member is from 3,000 to 5,000 feet thick and grades upward into the Belridge Diatomite Member. It overlies similar siliceous shale of the Gould Shale Member from which it is differentiated mainly by a color change; the McLure Shale Member weathers white, whereas the Gould Shale Member weathers cream to buff and is some what less siliceous and more fissile. Near Taft and Maricopa, the McLure Shale Member contains several lenses of sandstone.

The McLure Shale Member contains much diatom debris, arenaceous foraminifers, and fish scales. It also contains sparse calcareous foraminifers diagnostic of the Mohnian Stage, late Miocene (R. L. Pierce, oral commun., 1968). Only in the extreme southeastern part of the Temblor Range do the lowest beds contain foraminifers of the middle Miocene Luisian Stage (Vedder, 1970).

Tms,,"Sandstone lenses, Monterey Shale (Miocene)",
Tmd,,"Devilwater Shale Member, Monterey Shale (Luisian Stage; Miocene)","The argillaceous shale that forms the upper part of the lower division of the Monterey Shale in the northwestern Temblor Range is locally known as the ""Devilwater Silt"" (Bailey, 1939, p. 317; Heikkila and MacLeod, 1951, p. 11-12, pi. 1; Foss and Blaisdell, 1968, p. 38). It is presumably named for Devilwater Creek (fig. 9). This name is adopted herein because of its long established usage but is modified to Devilwater Shale Member because it is not ""silt"" (an unconsolidated sediment) but is clayey shale with lesser amounts of siltstone and fine-grained sandstone. The type section is here designated as the section exposed at Chico Martinez Creek, where it is composed of 1,190 feet of soft clayey shale, locally containing abundant foraminifers, and silty mudstone (Monterey Shale units 3 and 4 of Woodring and others, 1940, p. 125) separating the Gould Shale Member below from the McLure Shale Member above (fig. 10).

The Devilwater Shale Member is about 1,000 feet thick in most exposures. It persists northwest of Packwood Creek into the southwest foothills of the Diablo Range east of Cholame Valley, where it was mapped as the upper Temblor Sandstone by Marsh (1960, pi. 1) and as the oiltstone member of the Vaqueros-Temblor Formation by Dickinson (1966a, p. 711-713, pi. 2). The Devilwater Shale Member is also present in the Devils Den area, where it is about 700 feet thick. There it was called Alferitz Formation and assigned to the Luisian Stage, middle Miocene, by Van Couvering and Allen (1943, p. 496-500), but the name Alferitz is not adopted.

In the Temblor Range the Devilwater Shale Member contains foraminifers diagnostic of the middle Miocene Luisian Stage (Foss and Blaisdell, 1968, p. 38). It is presumably of the same age in the Diablo Range. In the subsurface of the Kettleman Hills, it and the correlative of the Gould Shale Member are represented mostly by sandstone which there was assigned to the Temblor Formation by Woodring, Stewart, and Richards (1940, fig. 8).

Tmg,,"Gould Shale Member, Monterey Shale (mostly Relizian and Luisian Stages; Miocene)","The siliceous shale that forms the lowest unit of the Monterey Shale exposed at Chico Martinez Creek was named the Gould Shale Member of the Temblor Formation by Cunningham and Barbat (1932, p. 418) for nearby Gould Hill (fig. 10). They designated the type locality as the area between the exposure along that creek and 2 miles southeastward (fig. 10). This name was adopted as a member of the Monterey Shale by Woodring, Bramlette, and Kleinpell (1936, p. 127-146), Woodring, Stewart, and Richards (1940, p. 125), Heikkila and MacLeod (1951, p. 11-12), and Foss and Blaisdell (1968, p. 38).

The Gould Shale Member is composed of tan-weathering thin-bedded brittle siliceous shale alternating with softer fissile shale. It conformably overlies the Buttonbed Sandstone Member of the Temblor Formation and is overlain by the Devilwater Shale Member of the Monterey Shale. At the type locality, the Gould Shale Member is 285 feet thick (Woodring and others, 1940, p. 125), but to the northwest it is as thick as 600 feet. From the type locality, it is traceable northwestward for about 20 miles and then disappears, never to reappear.

In all these exposures, the Gould Shale Member contains foraminifers diagnostic of the Relizian Stage, middle Miocene (Kleinpell, 1938, fig. 14; Foss and Blaisdell, 1968, p. 38).

In the southeastern part of the Temblor Range and southwest flank of the central part, all the lower division, or middle Miocene part, of the Monterey Shale is composed of siliceous shale lithologically similar to the Gould Shale Member of the Chico Martinez Creek area. All this siliceous shale is therefore assigned to the Gould Shale Member on the basis of lithologic similarity, even though the upper part is presumably correlative in age with the Devilwater Shale Member of the Chico Martinez Creek area (fig. 10). In the southeastern Temblor Range, this siliceous shale unit was informally called Devilwater-Gould member of the Monterey
(Simonson and Krueger, 1942, p. 1611, 1616, 1626- 1627; Dibblee, 1962, 1968). This unit, now designated as the Gould Shale Member, is from 2,000 to 3,000 feet thick; it conformably overlies clay shale of the Temblor Formation and is overlain by the McLure Shale Member of the Monterey Shale. In these exposures, the Gould Shale Member contains foraminifers diagnostic of the Relizian Stage in the lower part and Luisian Stage, middle Miocene, in the upper part. In one place in the extreme southeastern Temblor Range, however, the lowest strata of this siliceous shale unit contain foraminifers diagnostic of the late Saucesian Stage, early Miocene (R. L. Pierce, oral commun., 1967).

The shale is semisiliceous and contains about 50 percent interbedded light-gray sandstone. The shale contains foraminifers diagnostic of the Relizian and Luisian Stages, middle Miocene (Vedder, 1970), and is therefore correlative with the Gould Shale Member east of the Recruit Pass fault.

Tmw,,"Whiterock Bluff Shale Member, Monterey Shale (Relizian and Luisian Stages; Miocene)","In the Caliente Range, La Panza Range, and Sierra Madre Mountains, the siliceous shale unit was named the Whiterock Bluff Shale Member of the Santa Margarita Formation by English (1916, p. 191-215, pi. XIX). This shale unit was named for Whiterock Bluff, the type locality (sec. 25, T. 11 N., R. 28 W.), about 8 miles west-northwest of New Cuyama (fig. 1), where this shale is approximately 1,200 feet thick. This name was adopted and applied to this shale unit by Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958, p. 2990-2991), but the unit was reassigned to the Monterey Shale. The Whiterock Bluff Shale Member was reported by them to contain foraminifers diagnostic of late Relizian and Luisian Stages, middle Miocene. This name as used by Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958) is adopted herein for this shale unit in the area between the San Andreas and Rinconada faults.

The Whiterock Bluff Shale Member consists of hard, brittle thin-bedded siliceous shale and interbedded fissile to punky shale. It is as much as 1,500 feet thick, but averages 1,200 feet. It is gradational downward into the Saltos Shale Member and upward into sandstone of the Santa Margarita Formation. For about 6 miles on each side of Indian Creek (about 12 miles south of Shandon, fig. 2), a zone about 70 feet thick near the top of the Whiterock Bluff Shale Member contains thin layers of phosphatic pellets and bentonite (H. D. Gower, oral commun., 1970). This zone is overlain by about 80 feet of siliceous and diatomaceous shale, which is overlain by the Santa Margarita Formation. In western Cuyama Valley and on the southwest flank of the La Panza Range, the Whiterock Bluff Shale Member is absent or may be represented by sandstone. Elsewhere this shale unit is widely distributed, and in Salinas Valley this member and the underlying Saltos Shale Member are recognizable in well logs as far northeast as San Juan Creek. It is noteworthy, however, that within 7-10 miles of the San Andreas fault, as in the Caliente Range, this siliceous shale unit grades laterally northeastward through siltstone of the Saltos Shale Member lithology into the Branch Canyon Sandstone (figs. 7, 12).

In many places the Whiterock Bluff Shale Member contains abundant calcareous foraminifers. These are diagnostic of the Luisian Stage, middle Miocene. The exposure of the Whiterock Bluff Shale Member in sec. 21, T. 28 S., R. 14 E., 12 miles east of Atascadero (fig. 2) is the type locality of the Luisian Stage, as defined by Kleinpell (1938, p. 121- 123). In the Indian Creek area, the phosphatic pellet zone near the top of the member and 30 feet of the overlying shale also contain foraminifers of the Luisian Stage (H. D. Gower, oral commun., 1970). At the type locality of the Whiterock Bluff Shale Member in Cuyama Valley, this member is mainly in the Luisian Stage, but the lowest part is in the upper Relizian Stage (Hill and others, 1958, p. 2991), middle Miocene.

Tma,,"Saltos Shale Member, Monterey Shale (Saucesian and Relizian Stages; Miocene)","The Saltos Shale Member was named for Saltos Creek near the type locality (sees. 18, 19, and 20, T. 11 N., R. 27 W., San Bernardino base line and meridian) in the central Caliente Range, 8-9 miles northwest of New Cuyama, by Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958, p. 2989-2990), and the name is herein adopted. According to them, the member is about 2,150 feet thick at the type locality: the lower part, about 1,000 feet thick, is composed of gray clay shale and siltstone and is separated by a sill of basalt about 75 feet thick from the upper part, about 1,100 feet of soft fissile shale and hard, brittle siliceous shale and frequent thin beds of dolomite. The lower part was assigned to the Saucesian Stage, early Miocene, and the upper part to the Relizian Stage, middle Miocene.

The Saltos Shale Member exposed northwestward along the Caliente Range and in the La Panza Range is generally similar to that at the type locality, but in these places it lacks the basalt and averages about 1,500 feet in thickness. In the La Panza and northwestern Caliente Ranges, the Saltos Shale Member is composed of soft-weathering yellowish-gray thin-bedded clayey to weakly siliceous or calcareous shale and contains a foraminiferal fauna of the Relizian Stage, middle Miocene. It conformably overlies the Painted Rock Sandstone Member of the Vaqueros Formation, in places with a gradational or intertonguing contact. In both these areas this shale unit is lithologically similar to and correlative with the Sandholdt Formation of Thorup (1943) in Salinas Valley.

Near the west end of Cuyama Valley, the lower 150 feet of the Saltos Shale(?) Member is semi-siliceous shale, and the upper 500 feet is clay shale that is overlain by the Branch Canyon(?) Sandstone. The shale there contains foraminifers assigned to the lower(?) Saucesian Stage (R. L. Pierce, oral commun., 1967). Where the Vaqueros Sandstone is missing, the shale overlies the Simmler Formation and underlying rocks of Paleocene(?) age with angular discordance of as much as 45°. This is the only place between the San Andreas and Rinconada faults where an angular unconformity appears within the middle Tertiary sedimentary sequence.

On the northeast flank of the Caliente Range, on both flanks southeast of Caliente Mountain, and in the eastern San Rafael Mountains, the Saltos Shale Member becomes mainly siltstone, in places containing sparse foraminifers of the Saucesian and Relizian Stages, and thin sandstone beds that contain mollusks of the ""Temblor Stage"" (Vedder and Repenning, 1965). Included in the Saltos Shale Member of these exposures is several hundred feet of similar but stratigraphically higher siltstone that contains foraminifers of the Luisian Stage and that grades laterally westerward into the Whiterock Bluff Shale Member (fig. 7). The siltstone of the Saltos Shale Member intertongues northeastward into the Branch Canyon Sandstone within a few miles of the San Andreas fault (fig. 12).

This usage is retained herein. This conglomerate, which also includes lenses of breccia and sandstone, is as much as 2,500 feet thick. It intertongues northeastward, downdip, into the Belridge Diatomite Member of the Monterey Shale.

Tbs,,Branch Canyon Sandstone (Miocene),"Marine sandstone that grades laterally westward into the Monterey Shale in the Sierra Madre Mountains and Caliente Range (fig. 7) was named the Branch Canyon Formation by Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958, p. 2991-2993) for Branch Canyon (3 miles south of New Cuyama), the type section (sec. 2. T. 9 N., R. 27 W.). This usage is adopted herein but the name is modified to Branch Canyon Sandstone.

In the Branch Canyon area south of Cuyama Valley, the Branch Canyon Sandstone is about 3,200 feet thick. The lower 2,100 feet (""Vaqueros,"" ""Temblor,"" and ""Briones,"" of Eaton and others, 1941, fig. 13) contains mollusks and echinoids diagnostic of the ""Temblor Stage,"" middle Miocene. The upper 1,100 feet (""upper Briones,"" ""Cierbo,"" and ""lower Neroly"" of Eaton and others, 1941, fig. 13) contains mollusks and echinoids diagnostic of the ""Santa Margarita Stage,"" late Miocene, and is overlain by the Santa Margarita Formation. Farther east, the Branch Canyon Sandstone is overlapped by and tongues out into nonmarine formations.

In the Caliente Range, the Branch Canyon Sandstone is as much as 3,000 feet thick. There it contains mollusks of the ""Temblor Stage,"" middle Miocene, only. It intertongues southwestward into the Saltos Shale Member of the Monterey Shale in both northwestern and southeastern parts of the range. In the southeastern part, it is overlain by and tongues laterally eastward into the Caliente Formation.

Several wells drilled for petroleum in the western parts of the Carrizo Plain and near the San Juan River to the northwest and a well northwest of Cholame penetrated sandstone of, or correlative with, the Branch Canyon Sandstone. These occurrences and the exposures of this sandstone along the northeastern flank of the Caliente Range suggest that the Branch Canyon Sandstone may be continuous under the southwestern part of the Carrizo Plain to and beyond Cholame. Along this strip, this marine sandstone intertongues southwestward into the Monterey Shale and northeastward toward the San Andreas fault into the Caliente Formation (fig. 12). Similar conditions prevail in the eastern Sierra Madre Mountains and presumably under Cuyama Valley. These relations indicate that the Branch Canyon Sandstone is essentially a strandline deposit between the Monterey Shale deposited offshore to the southwest and the terrestrial Caliente Formation to the northeast.

Tb,,Basalt extrusive and intrusive rocks (Miocene),"Exposures of volcanic flows, sills, and dikes of olivine basalt are present only in the middle Tertiary sedimentary sequence in the Caliente Range and on the east margin of the La Panza Range (fig. 7). Most of the flows are in the Monterey Shale, Branch Canyon Sandstone, and middle and upper Miocene parts of the Caliente Formation of the Caliente Range. Dikes are locally abundant in the Vaqueros and Simmler Formations near Soda Lake, and several sills occur in the Vaqueros Formation.

In the southeastern Caliente Range, two of three prominent basalt flows (""Triple basalts"" of Eaton, 1939; Hill and others, 1958, p. 2994; and Vedder and Repenning, 1965) were radiometrically dated by Turner (1970, p. 115): the upper flow was dated as about 14.2 and 14.4 million years, and the lower one as about 16.1 million years. Both flows are in the Branch Canyon Sandstone, which contains a ""Temblor"" fauna and which intertongues eastward into the part of the Caliente Formation that contains a ""Barstovian"" fauna.

Tc,,"Caliente Formation (Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene)","In areas southwest of the San Andreas fault, terrestrial deposits that intertongue westward into the marine deposits of Miocene age (fig. 7) were named the Caliente Formation by Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee, 1958 p. 2993-2995) for the Caliente Range. The type locality was designated in the southeastern part of the range in sees. 26 and 23, T. 11 N., R. 26 W., 5-6 miles northeast of New Cuyama. This usage is adopted herein.

The Caliente Formation of the Caliente Range is as thick as 4,200 feet and consists of varicolored sandstone, claystone, conglomerate, and four units of basalt. It has yielded vertebrate remains diagnostic of the following ages of the mammalian chronology (fig. 4): Arikareean, late Oligocene(?) and early Miocene; Hemingfordian, middle Miocene; Barstovian, middle(?) and late Miocene; Clarendonian, late Miocene (?); and Hemphillian, Pliocene (Repenning and Vedder, 1961; Vedder and Repenning, 1965). It is therefore assigned an Oligocene(?), Miocene, and Pliocene age (fig. 7), but it is mostly of Miocene age.

The strata of the Caliente Formation that contain mammalian faunas assigned to the Arikareean, Hemingfordian, and early Barstovian ages intertongue westward into marine beds that have yielded molluscan faunas diagnostic of the ""Temblor Stage"" and foraminiferal faunas diagnostic of the Saucesian, Relizian, and Luisian Stages in the central Caliente Range. The strata that contain mammalian faunas assigned to the late Barstovian, Clarendonian, and Hemphillian ""ages"" are overlain by the Quatal Formation and are considered in part if not in whole correlative with the Santa Margarita Formation, which is also overlain by the Quatal Formation south of Cuyama Valley and northwest of Carrizo Plain. If all the upper strata of the Caliente Formation correlate with the Santa Margarita Formation, then the Santa Margarita, of late Miocene age of the marine invertebrate chronology, may be in part Pliocene of the mammalian chronology. Until the relationship of the mammalian ""ages"" to the marine ""ages"" and stages is more precisely known, this problem is unresolved.

In the Santa Barbara Canyon area southeast of Cuyama Valley, red beds that underlie the Branch Canyon Sandstone were named the Pato Red Member of the Vaqueros Formation by English (1916, p. 200, pi. XIX), but assigned to the Caliente Formation (by Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958, p. 2995). The latter usage is retained, and the name Pato is considered obsolete. These beds contain sparse mammalian remains that suggest Arikareean age (J. G. Vedder, oral commun., 1968).

In the Red Hills northwest of Carrizo Plain, the granitic basement is overlain by about 3,000 feet of red to gray coarse boulder-cobble conglomerate of granitic detritus. This conglomerate is questionably referred to the Caliente Formation and is presumably of middle or late Miocene age, but it may be in part of early Miocene or Oligocene(?) age. It is overlain by sandstone that has late Miocene fossils and is assigned to the Santa Margarita Formation but that could be correlative with the Branch Canyon Sandstone.

A well drilled for petroleum about 2 miles east of the Red Hills penetrated terrestrial beds of the Caliente(?) Formation to a depth of 2,910 feet, then struck granitic basement. Another well about 11 miles northwest of the Red Hills or 2V& miles northwest of Cholame was drilled through terrestrial sedimentary rocks, presumably of the Caliente Formation, similar to those in the Red Hills from depths of 1,950 to 6,523 feet, then entered granitic basement.

About 18 miles southeast of the Red Hills, red sandy beds which intertongue(?) southwestward into the Santa Margarita Formation crop out.

The widely scattered exposures of the Caliente Formation are probably only a very small part of its total areal extent; it is largely covered by younger formations. This terrestrial unit or facies probably underlies the southeastern part of Cuyama Valley and possibly much of the northeast margin of Carrizo Plain (fig. 12), as suggested by the distribution of the formation in surface exposures and well sections referred to. If the Caliente Formation is continuous along this strip, it intertongues southwestward into the Branch Canyon Sandstone and was deposited along a coastal plain adjacent to the Miocene sea to the southwest. The position of the west margin of the continental facies southwest of the San Andreas fault is about as postulated by Hill and Dibblee (1953, p. 446-448) but extends farther northwest. The granitic detritus that makes up the Caliente Formation was derived from a granitic terrane that presumably lay northeast of the San Andreas fault in middle Tertiary time.

To the northwest, west, and southwest, this formation thins to about 1,000 feet or less under Salinas Valley and in the La Panza Range. In western Cuyama Valley and in the Sierra Madre Mountains, it is either absent or very thin.

In areas other than the Caliente Range, the Vaqueros Formation is mostly all sandstone and is undivided.

Tvp,,"Sandstone, Painted Rock Sandstone Member, Vaqueros Formation (Saucesian Stage; Oligocene and Miocene)","The Painted Rock Sandstone Member was named for Painted Rock, a prominent cavernous sandstone outcrop south of Soda Lake, but the type locality is the section exposed in the vicinity of Caliente Mountain, 7 miles northwest of New Cuyama (Hill and others, 1958, p. 2986, 2988). In the northwestern Caliente Range this member is nearly all sandstone, but at Caliente Mountain and a few miles eastward it includes as much as 50 percent interbedded siltstone. In these areas this member is about 5,500 feet thick. It thins to the southeast, in part by lateral gradation of its lower beds into the Soda Lake Shale Member and of its upper beds into the terrestrial Caliente Formation and in part by actual thinning of the whole member. At the southeast end of the Caliente Range, the Painted Rock Sandstone Member is only about 600 feet thick.

The Painted Rock Sandstone Member in the vicinity of Caliente Mountain and southeastward contains abundant Turritella ocoyana and Lyropecten miguelensis, especially in its upper and middle parts. In other areas these species occur in sandstones of ""Temblor age."" Eaton, Grant, and Alien (1941) assigned the upper 900 feet of this sandstone unit to the ""Temblor"" and the rest to the ""Vaqueros."" The fauna throughout this member is now considered to be of ""Vaqueros age,"" early Miocene (Repenning and Vedder, 1961). In the northwestern Caliente Range, the uppermost sandstones of this member are somewhat higher stratigraphically than those near Caliente Peak and may be of ""Temblor Age,"" middle Miocene.

The Painted Rock Sandstone Member contains undiagnostic shallow-water foraminifers, but foraminifers diagnostic of the Saucesian Stage, early Miocene, occur in the underlying beds of the Soda Lake Shale Member and west of Caliente Mountain in the immediately overlying beds of the Monterey Shale (vedder and Repenning, 1965).

On the northeast flank of La Panza Range, the Vaqueros Formation is nearly all sandstone and ranges form about 200 to 1,200 feet in thickness. It is assigned to the Painted Rock Sandstone Member because it is lithologically similar to that units in the nearby northwestern Caliente Range and is conformable overlain vy the Saltos Shelae Member of the Monterey Shale. In most places the Painted Rock Sandstone Member rests unconformably on the crystalline basement rocks of on the Upper Cretaceous and lower Tertiary sedimentary sequence against which the lower beds buttress out. In other places this member conformably overlies conglomerate of the Simmler Formation, and at La Panza Canyon (in sec. 36, T. 29 S., R. 16 E.) it overlies a thin intervening wedge as thick as 200 feet of the Soda Lake(?) Shale Member of the Vaqueros Formation.

The upper part of the Painted Rock Sandstone Member of La Panza Range is generally fine grained and fossiliferous, with abundant fossils of the Turritella ocoyana zone of ""Temblor age,"" lower or middle Miocene. The lower part is medium to coarse grained, nearly white, and rarely fossiliferous, although fossils of the Turritella inezana zone or ""Vaqueros age,"" lower Miocene, were reported and listed by Loel and Corey (1932, p. 107 and correlation chart).

Tvl,,"Soda Lake Shale Member, Vaqueros Formation (Saucesian and Zemorrian Stages; Oligocene and Miocene)","The Soda Lake Shale Member consists of dark-gray silty clay shale, claystone, and siltstone. The type section is in the northwestern Caliente Range (NE 1/4 sec. 6, T. 31 S., R. 19 E., and extreme SE 1/4 sec. 31, T. 30 S., R. 19 E.), 3 miles west of the north end of Soda Lake (Hill and others, 1958, p. 2983, 2985). There, it is about 1,200 feet thick and contains a prominent bed of chert just below the middle. It contains foraminifers diagnostic of the Zemorrian Stage (late Oligocene) below that chert bed and foraminifers of the Saucesian Stage (early Miocene) above it.

The Soda Lake Shale Member is also exposed in the southeastern Caliente Range, where the probable time-stratigraphic equivalent of the type section is about 900 feet thick or less. It is of the same lithology as at the type section and in one place contains a lens of chert a few feet thick, just below the middle. It is in part overlain by as much as 2,000 feet of siltstone and some interbedded sandstone that was included in the Soda Lake Shale Member of this area by Vedder and Repenning (1965) because of its predominant stilstone lithology. According to them, this part contains foraminifers diagnostic of the Saucesian Stage and mollusks diagnostic of the ""Vaqueros age."" Near the southeast end of this range, all the strata assigned to the Soda Lake Shale Member grade laterally eastward into the Painted Rock Sandstone Member.

According to R. L. Pierce (oral commun., 1970), the part of the Soda Lake Shale Member below the
chert bed at the type section and the lowest part of this member in the Cuyama Valley oil fields contain a neritic foraminiferal fauna diagnostic of the late Zemorrian Stage and are probably correlative with the Agua Sandstone Member and part of the underlying lower part of the Santos Shale Member of the Temblor Formation as defined herein; the part above the chert bed at the type section and the upper part in the Cuyama Valley oil fields contain a subabyssal fauna diagnostic of the early Saucesian Stage and are probably correlative with the upper part of the
Santos Shale Member of the Temblor Formation as defined herein. The faunas of the Soda Lake Shale
Member, according to Pierce, however, are unlike those of the San Joaquin Valley, but are similar to those of the same age in the Santa Ynez Mountains. Thus, the basin in which this member accumulated was probably not connected with the San Joaquin Valley basin at that time, as suggested by Cross (1962, p. 27).

Tvq,,"Quail Canyon Sandstone Member, Vaqueros Formation (Zemorrian Stage; Oligocene and Miocene)","The Soda Lake Shale Member in the southeastern Caliente Range is underlain in large part by a thin sandstone unit that was called the Soda Lake Sandstone Member by Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958, p. 2984). Because the name Soda Lake is already applied to the overlying shale unit, this sandstone unit is here renamed the Quail Canyon Sandstone Member of the Vaqueros Formation. It is named for exposures in Quail Canyon, Cuyama quadrangle, 1964. The type locality is in the NWViSWi/i sec. 4, T. 10 N., R. 25 W., which is the same as that designated by Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958, p. 2984) for the Soda Lake Sandstone Member. It conformably overlies red beds of the Simmler For- mation and was described by Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958, p. 2984) as follows:

The sandstone in the type section attains a maximum thickness of 300 feet. It thins westward by a probable gradation into Soda Lake shale and toward the southeast it becomes undifferentiated from the overlying Painted Rock sandstone (T. 10 N., R. 25 W.). At its type locality * * * the Soda Lake sandstone is characteristically gray-white, weathering to light buff, massively bedded, fine to medium grained, well sorted, and very firmly indurated. It is commonly cross-bedded with fore-set beds dipping in a westerly direction.

This sandstone member contains Pecten magnolia and other forms diagnostic of ""Vaqueros age"" (J. G. Vedder, oral commun., 1968), Oligocene. According to R. L. Pierce (oral commun., 1970), this sandstone member is probably correlative with the Agua Sandstone Member of the Temblor Formation, and with the Vaqueros Sandstone of the Santa Ynez Mountains. The Quail Canyon Sandstone Member is assigned to the late Zemorrian Stage, late Oligocene, on the basis of the foregoing evidence.

Ttg,,"Basal conglomerate lens, Temblor Formation (Oligocene and Miocene)","In the Temblor Range the Temblor Formation is composed of sandstone and lesser amounts of argillaceous sedimentary rocks. In the southeastern part of the range, as much as 7,000 feet crops out; the base of this unit is unexposed. In the northwestern part this unit is much thinner but of variable thickness. At the northwest end of the Temblor Range and on the southwest flank of the Diablo Range near Cholame Valley, the Temblor Formation is nearly all sandstone and is 0-5,000 feet thick but generally less than 2,000 feet. At one place about 5 miles northeast of Cholame, the Temblor Formation contains a lens, as much as 500 feet thick, of terrestrial red beds, as mapped by Dickinson (1966a, p. 711, pi. 1). At a locality 7 miles slightly south of east of Cholame, the formation contains a basal conglomerate lens as thick as 500 feet. The Temblor Formation is largely absent in the McLure Valley area, but is present at Devils Den and Reef Ridge.

Throughout the central and northwestern parts of the Temblor Range and adjacent part of the Diablo Range, the Temblor Formation rests either disconforambly or unconformably on the lower Tertiary, Cretaceous, and Franciscan rocks, overlapping them from northeast to southwest with increasing discordance toward the San Andreas fault.

In most places the Temblor Formation is differentiable only into its facies of (1) sandstone, (2) argillaceous sedimentary rocks, and (3) basal conglomerate (in one area only). These are unnamed; however, on the northeast flank of the central part of the Temblor Range between Salt Creek and Bitterwater Creek (fig. 9) and in the nearby oil fields, the Temblor Formation has for many years been divided informally by petroleum geologists into units or members given local names. These units are of little regional significance because they are thin, very lenticular, and in outcrop recognizable only in this part of the range. In the subsurface, however, they are economically very important because the sandstone units contain oil that is produced under favorable structural conditions, and the shale units form the caprocks. Mention is made of these units in articles on descriptions of the nearby oil fields, as well as in reports by Kleinpell (1938, p. 106, fig. 6) and Goudkoff (1943), and the units are described, with pertinent references by Foss and Blaisdell (1968, p. 33-43). These units, herein designated as members, are shown in table 2.

Anderson (1905, p. 169-170) originally described the ""Temblor Beds"" at ""Canara Springs"" (Carneros Spring in fig. 10) and at ""Temblor."" He never designated a type section, but Kleinpell (1938, p. 107) and Curran (1943, p. 1364) considered the section at Carneros Creek described by Anderson to be the type locality of the Temblor Formation. Kleinpell (1938, p. 107), Woodring, Stewart, and Richards (1940, p. 130), and Curran (1943, p. 1369-1370) described the Temblor Formation exposed 2 miles south in Zemorra Creek, a branch of Chico Martinez Creek (fig. 10), where the Temblor Formation is thicker and more completely exposed than at Carneros Creek.
It is here proposed that the type area of the Temblor Formation be designated as the exposures from Carneros Creek to Zemorra Creek, the type section as that exposed at Carneros Creek in sec. 32, T. 28 S., R. 20 E., and a reference section as that exposed at Zemorra Creek in sec. 9, T. 29 S., R. 20 E. (figs. 9, 10). This type section is also the type section of some members of the Temblor Formation and the reference section for the others, as indicated in the following paragraphs. Part of this section is also the type section of the Zemorrian Stage as defined by Kleinpell (1938, p. 106-108). The members of the Temblor Formation in the Chico Martinez Creek area (fig. 10) are herein defined in ascending order (thickness figures at Zemorra Creek as given by Woodring and others, 1940, p. 130).

The age of the Temblor Formation in its type area ranges from the early Zemorrian Stage, late Oligocene, through the Saucesian Stage, early Miocene, to the lowest part of the Relizian Stage, middle Miocene. This age range probably also applies to the Temblor Formation and Devils Den. In areas west and northwest of the type area and at Reef Ridge, the Temblor Formation is mainly in the Saucesian Stage, early Miocene, and partly of Relizian age, middle Miocene.

Ttb,,"Buttonbed Sandstone Member, Temblor Formation (Relizian Stage; Oligocene and Miocene)","Anderson (1905, p. 170) referred to the top sandstone unit of his Temblor Beds at Carneros Creek as ""button beds."" This term has subsequently been commonly applied informally to this sandstone
(Kleinpell, 1938, p. 105; Foss and Blaisdell, 1968, p. 38). The type locality was designated as Carneros Creek (Heikkila and MacLeod, 1951, p. 10), in sec. 32, T. 28 S., R. 20 E. (fig. 10). It is here formally named the Buttonbed Sandstone Member for its exposure on Buttonbed Hill (fig. 10). This sandstone is light gray, thick bedded, and commonly calcareous, with numerous shell fragments. It ranges in thickness from 0 to 500 feet (240 ft thick at Zemorra Creek, the reference section). It is presumed to be locally disconformable on the Media Shale Member and may be a transgressive basal sandstone of the Monterey Shale, as indicated by an unconformity locally at its base in the Shale Hills area (Heikkila and MacLeod, 1951, p. 10) and at Devils Den. In other areas, this sandstone member or its equivalent is not differentiate from the underlying sandstone fades of the Temblor Formation.

The Buttonbed Sandstone Member is traceable northwestward from Zemorra Creek to and beyond Bitterwater Creek. Northwest of Devilwater Creek all but the upper part intertongues into the upper part of the Media Shale Member.

The Buttonbed Sandstone Member contains mollusks and buttonlike echinoids (mostly Scutella merriami) assigned to ""Temblor age,"" Miocene, (W. 0. Addicott, oral commun., 1967). In the Chico Martinez Creek area, the Buttonbed Sandstone Member is in the early Relizian Stage (middle Miocene), as indicated by the microfauna in the adjacent shale below and above (R. L. Pierce, oral commun., 1968).

At Devils Den, local names were applied to units within the Temblor Formation by Van Couvering and Alien (1943, p. 496-500); none of these are adopted herein. The members recognized in the Chico Martinez Creek area of the Temblor Range are believed to be as indicated in table 3, mainly on the basis of similar lithologic sequences, although correlations are uncertain. In the northern exposures, the Buttonbed Sandstone Member overlaps the older members of the Temblor Formation.

Ttm,,"Media Shale Member, Temblor Formation (Relizian and Saucesian Stages; Oligocene and Miocene)","The name Media was first applied to the upper shale member of the Temblor Formation by Cunningham and Barbat (1932, p. 417-421), for Media Agua Creek (fig. 9). The Media Shale Member is light gray, clayey to silty, and in part semisiliceous. It is conformable on the Carneros Sandstone Member, is 920 feet thick at Zemorra Creek, the designated type section (sec. 9, T. 29 S., R. 20 E., Carneros Rocks quadrangle), and about 500 feet thick at Carneros and Santos Creeks. It is traceable northwest to and beyond the mouth of Cedar Creek (figs. 9, 11). Northwest of Devilwater Creek it thickens as the upper parts of the Carneros Sandstone Member and lower parts of the Buttonbed Sandstone Member intertongue into it. In the Cedar Creek area the Media Shale Member is as thick as 2,200 feet, and the upper part includes much hard semisiliceous shale.

In the Chico Martinez Creek area, the Media Shale Member contains foraminifers diagnostic of the upper Saucesian Stage, early Miocene; the uppermost 50 feet, a sandy siltstone, contains foraminifers diagnostic of the lower Relizian Stage, middle Miocene (Foss and Blaisdell, 1968, p. 39).

Ttr,,"Carneros Sandstone Member, Temblor Formation (Saucesian Stage; Oligocene and Miocene)","The name Carneros was first applied to the middle sandstone member of the Temblor Formation by Cunningham and Barbat (1932, p. 417-421) for Carneros Creek, the type locality (fig. 10). The Carneros Sandstone Member is conformable on the Santos Shale Member, is light gray and thick bedded, rarely contains fossils, and is about 215 feet thick at Zemorra Creek, the reference section, but as much as 500 feet thick in the area of figure 9. It is traceaible as far northwest as Cedar Creek (fig. 11). Northwest of Devilwater Creek the upper part intertongues into the lower part of the Media Shale Member, and the lowest sandstone tongue persists as a layer about 120 feet thick. Northeastward, downdip, the Carneros Sandstone Member thickens to more than 1,000 feet locally in the subsurface. It is within the Saucesian Stage, early Miocene, as indicated by foraminifers from the shales below and above.

Ttn,,"Upper part of Santos Shale Member, Temblor Formation (Saucesian Stage; Oligocene and Miocene)","The middle shale member of the Temblor Formation was named the Santos Shale by Gester and Galloway (1933) for Santos Creek, the type locality (fig. 9). This shale is medium to dark gray, clayey to silty, locally semisiliceous in the upper part, and is conformable on the Wygal Sandstone Member. At Zemorra Creek, the reference section, this shale member is 295 feet thick and is divided into two parts, but the lower part, 180 feet thick, is separated from the upper part, about 60 feet thick, by the 35-foot-thick Agua Sandstone Member. The upper part of the Santos Shale Member is traceable northwestward to Cedar Creek, where it overlies the Agua Sandstone Member and the Point of Rocks Sandstone (fig. 11). Northeastward, downdip, the Santos Shale Member thickens in the subsurface, and the lower and upper parts are separated by the Agua Sandstone Member (Foss and Blaisdell, 1968, p. 39-40). The Santos Shale Member contains fora- minifers diagnostic of the Zemorrian Stage, late Oligocene, in the lower part and of the Saucesian Stage, early Miocene, in the upper part (Kleinpell, 1938, p. 105-108; Foss and Blaisdell, 1968, p. 40). At Zemorra Creek the lower part forms the upper part of the type Zemorrian Stage of Kleinpell (1938, p. 103-108), except the lowest 50 feet of that shale, which is assigned to the lower part of that stage (Foss and Blaisdell, 1968, p. 40).

The Agua Sandstone Member was named Agua Sandstone by Clark and Clark (1935, p. 137) for Media Agua Creek (fig. 9). They did not designate a type locality, although they mentioned the outcrop at the mouth of Cedar Creek. This outcrop is designated the type locality as it was mapped by Heikkila and MacLeod (1951, pi. 1). This is the only other place besides Zemorra, Creek, the reference section, where this unit crops out, although at a few places between Cedar Creek and Zemorra Creek, the Santos Shale Member contains a sandstone bed a few feet thick that may be correlative. In the subsurface (in North Belridge, North and South Antelope Hills, McDonald Anticline oil fields and vicinity, (fig. 9) the Agua Sandstone Member is persistent, is several hundred feet thick, and is assigned to the top of the Zemorrian Stage (Foss and Blaisdell, 1968, p. 40).

The Agua Sandstone Member is light gray, arkosic, and locally pebbly. At the mouth of Cedar Creek it is as thick as 48 feet, occurs at the base of the Santos Shale Member, and is disconformable on the Point of Rocks Sandstone (fig. 11). At this outcrop it contains a few fossils, including Pecten magnolia, and is assigned a late ""Vaqueros age"" (W. 0. Addicott, oral commun., 1968). At Zemorra Creek this sandstone is 35 feet thick, is unfossiliferous, and is at the top of the type Zemorrian Stage (Kleinpell, 1938, p. 103-108), late Oligocene.

Ttu,,"Undivided lower members sandstone and claystone, Temblor Formation (Zemorrian Stage; Oligocene and Miocene)","In the Temblor Range the Temblor Formation is composed of sandstone and lesser amounts of argillaceous sedimentary rocks. In the southeastern part of the range, as much as 7,000 feet crops out; the base of this unit is unexposed. In the northwestern part this unit is much thinner but of variable thickness. At the northwest end of the Temblor Range and on the southwest flank of the Diablo Range near Cholame Valley, the Temblor Formation is nearly all sandstone and is 0-5,000 feet thick but generally less than 2,000 feet. At one place about 5 miles northeast of Cholame, the Temblor Formation contains a lens, as much as 500 feet thick, of terrestrial red beds, as mapped by Dickinson (1966a, p. 711, pi. 1). At a locality 7 miles slightly south of east of Cholame, the formation contains a basal conglomerate lens as thick as 500 feet. The Temblor Formation is largely absent in the McLure Valley area, but is present at Devils Den and Reef Ridge.

Throughout the central and northwestern parts of the Temblor Range and adjacent part of the Diablo Range, the Temblor Formation rests either disconforambly or unconformably on the lower Tertiary, Cretaceous, and Franciscan rocks, overlapping them from northeast to southwest with increasing discordance toward the San Andreas fault.

In most places the Temblor Formation is differentiable only into its facies of (1) sandstone, (2) argillaceous sedimentary rocks, and (3) basal conglomerate (in one area only). These are unnamed; however, on the northeast flank of the central part of the Temblor Range between Salt Creek and Bitterwater Creek (fig. 9) and in the nearby oil fields, the Temblor Formation has for many years been divided informally by petroleum geologists into units or members given local names. These units are of little regional significance because they are thin, very lenticular, and in outcrop recognizable only in this part of the range. In the subsurface, however, they are economically very important because the sandstone units contain oil that is produced under favorable structural conditions, and the shale units form the caprocks. Mention is made of these units in articles on descriptions of the nearby oil fields, as well as in reports by Kleinpell (1938, p. 106, fig. 6) and Goudkoff (1943), and the units are described, with pertinent references by Foss and Blaisdell (1968, p. 33-43). These units, herein designated as members, are shown in table 2.

Anderson (1905, p. 169-170) originally described the ""Temblor Beds"" at ""Canara Springs"" (Carneros Spring in fig. 10) and at ""Temblor."" He never designated a type section, but Kleinpell (1938, p. 107) and Curran (1943, p. 1364) considered the section at Carneros Creek described by Anderson to be the type locality of the Temblor Formation. Kleinpell (1938, p. 107), Woodring, Stewart, and Richards (1940, p. 130), and Curran (1943, p. 1369-1370) described the Temblor Formation exposed 2 miles south in Zemorra Creek, a branch of Chico Martinez Creek (fig. 10), where the Temblor Formation is thicker and more completely exposed than at Carneros Creek.
It is here proposed that the type area of the Temblor Formation be designated as the exposures from Carneros Creek to Zemorra Creek, the type section as that exposed at Carneros Creek in sec. 32, T. 28 S., R. 20 E., and a reference section as that exposed at Zemorra Creek in sec. 9, T. 29 S., R. 20 E. (figs. 9, 10). This type section is also the type section of some members of the Temblor Formation and the reference section for the others, as indicated in the following paragraphs. Part of this section is also the type section of the Zemorrian Stage as defined by Kleinpell (1938, p. 106-108). The members of the Temblor Formation in the Chico Martinez Creek area (fig. 10) are herein defined in ascending order (thickness figures at Zemorra Creek as given by Woodring and others, 1940, p. 130).

The age of the Temblor Formation in its type area ranges from the early Zemorrian Stage, late Oligocene, through the Saucesian Stage, early Miocene, to the lowest part of the Relizian Stage, middle Miocene. This age range probably also applies to the Temblor Formation and Devils Den. In areas west and northwest of the type area and at Reef Ridge, the Temblor Formation is mainly in the Saucesian Stage, early Miocene, and partly of Relizian age, middle Miocene.

Tw,,"Clay shale unit, Wagonwheel Formation (Refugian Stage; Oligocene)","In the Devils Den area, a basal marine sandstone and a clayey shale unit, about 500 feet thick, were mapped as Oligocene(?) rocks by Arnold and Johnson (1910, p. 40). Johnson (1909, p. 63) had previously named this units the Wagonwheel Formation for exposures near Wagonwheel Mountain, 2 miles south of Devils Den, and had tentatively assigned it to the Oligocene. This name was used by Van Couvering and Allen (1943, fig. 213) and is adopted herein. Atwill (1935, p. 1207) correlated this unit with his Tumey Formation north of Coalinga.

The Wagonwheel Formation and its foraminiferal fauna were described and discussed in detail by Smith (1956). He assigned the formation to the Refugian Stage of the early Oligocene age and indicated that it lies conformably ont he Krehenhagen Shale and disconformably below the Temblor Formation. Because of these stratigraphic relationships, this unit, which is the only one wholly assigned to the Refugian Stage within this region, is placed arbitrarily at the top of the lower Tertiary marine sedimentary sequence, rather than in the middle Tertiary sedimentary sequence.

Tk,,"Undifferentiated shale, Kreyenhagen Shale (Eocene)","The clay shale and claystone facies of the lower Tertiary marine sedimentary sequence is prominently exposed in the Reef Ridge area north of McLure Valley. It was named Kreyenhagen Shale for Kreyenhagen wells at Canoas Creek (7 miles west of Avenal), the type locality, by Anderson (1905, p. 163-168). This name was not used by Arnold and Anderson (1910, p. 58-70) but was adopted by Cushman and Siegfus (1942), who described the sections exposed at Canoas and Garza Creeks (7 miles west of Avenal) and by Stewart (1946, p. 95, pi. 1), who described and mapped the formation in detail.

In the Reef Ridge area the Kreyenhagen Shale is from 950 to 1,250 feet thick, consists of gray clayey to silty shale, overlies the Avenal Sandstone, and is unconformably overlain by the Temblor Sandstone. The major part of the Kreyenhagen Shale contains foraminifers diagnostic of the Narizian Stage, late Eocene (Mallory, 1959, p. 71, fig. 7). Cushman and Siegfus (1942, p. 395-397) suggested that the upper part may be as young as Oligocene (Refugian). The lowest 50-110 feet of the Kreyenhagen Shale is greenish claystone which was named the Canoas Siltstone Member by Cushman and Siegfus (1942, p. 390-391) and which contains a foraminiferal fauna (""Canoas Fauna"") to which they assigned a middle Eocene age. Mallory (1959, p. 51, 71) suggested that this fauna may belong to his Ulatisian Stage, middle Eocene, but it is not certainly diagnostic.

In the Devils Den area the Kreyenhagen Shale is separated into two units of clayey shale by the Point of Rocks Sandstone (fig. 6). The lower unit, as thick as 700 feet, was named the Gredal Formation by Van Couvering and Alien (1943, p. 496-500). This same unit was designated as the Gredal Member of the Lodo Formation and assigned to the Ulatisian Stage, middle Eocene, by Mallory (1959, p. 45, 51, fig. 7), but it was mapped as the Canoas Siltstone Member of the Kreyenhagen Shale by Marsh (1960, p. 31, pi. 1). Because this unit is much thicker than the type Canoas Siltstone Member of Reef Ridge (too thin to show at the map scale), with which it is correlated by petroleum geologists, the unit at Devils Den is herein adopted as the Gredal Shale Member of the Kreyenhagen Shale. The type section of this member is designated as the section exposed in NE 1/4 sec. 10, T. 26 S., R. 18 E., 4 miles south of Devils Den, where it consists of about 750 feet of gray clayey shale with local occurrences of green and red clay, overlies the Avenal (""Mabury"") Sandstone, and is overlain by the Point of Rocks Sandstone.

In the northwestern Temblor Range, the Gredal Shale Member of the Kreyenhagen Shale is exposed south of Cedar Creek and at Media Agua Creek (fig. 9). In the former area, it is several hundred feet thick and consists of gray, green, and red claystone that unconformably overlies the Gravelly Flat Formation. At Media Agua Creek, it overlies the Avenal(?) Sandstone and is overlain by the Point of Rocks Sandstone, as at Devils Den; it is about 90 feet thick and is the same unit as the upper Lodo of Mallory (1959, p. 24, 45, figs. 3, 7), which he assigned to his Ulatisian Stage, middle Eocene.

The upper unit of the Kreyenhagen Shale in the Devils Den area is composed of about 600 feet of clayey shale that overlies the Point of Rocks Sandstone and is overlain by the Wagonwheel Formation. This shale unit was named Welcome Formation by Sandstone. The major part of the Kreyenhagen Van Couvering and Alien (1943, p. 496-500). This unit is herein adopted as the Welcome Shale Member of the Kreyenhagen Shale, with the type section designated as Welcome Valley (SE 1/4 sec. 35, T. 25 S., R. 18 E., NE*4NE14 sec. 2 and NWVi sec. 1, T. 26 S., R. 18 E.), just south of Devils Den. This unit is poorly and incompletely exposed; it is concealed by alluvium to the southeast and is overlapped by the Temblor Formation to the northwest. It forms the upper part of the type Narizian Stage, upper Eocene, of Mallory (1959, p. 55-56), although foraminifers of the Refugian Stage have been reported from the uppermost part of this shale unit by Smith (1956, p. 77-78) and Mallory (1959, p. 71).

On the basis of the foregoing evidence, the Gredal Shale Member of the Kreyenhagen Shale is assigned to the Ulatisian Stage, middle Eocene, and the Welcome Shale Member is assigned to the Narizian Stage, upper Eocene, with the upper part possibly extending into the Refugian Stage, early Oligocene.

In the Devils Den area the Kreyenhagen Shale is separated into two units of clayey shale by the Point of Rocks Sandstone (fig. 6). The lower unit, as thick as 700 feet, was named the Gredal Formation by Van Couvering and Alien (1943, p. 496-500). This same unit was designated as the Gredal Member of the Lodo Formation and assigned to the Ulatisian Stage, middle Eocene, by Mallory (1959, p. 45, 51, fig. 7), but it was mapped as the Canoas Siltstone Member of the Kreyenhagen Shale by Marsh (1960, p. 31, pi. 1). Because this unit is much thicker than the type Canoas Siltstone Member of Reef Ridge (too thin to show at the map scale), with which it is correlated by petroleum geologists, the unit at Devils Den is herein adopted as the Gredal Shale Member of the Kreyenhagen Shale. The type section of this member is designated as the section exposed in NE 1/4 sec. 10, T. 26 S., R. 18 E., 4 miles south of Devils Den, where it consists of about 750 feet of gray clayey shale with local occurrences of green and red clay, overlies the Avenal (""Mabury"") Sandstone, and is overlain by the Point of Rocks Sandstone.

In the northwestern Temblor Range, the Gredal Shale Member of the Kreyenhagen Shale is exposed south of Cedar Creek and at Media Agua Creek (fig. 9). In the former area, it is several hundred feet thick and consists of gray, green, and red claystone that unconformably overlies the Gravelly Flat Formation. At Media Agua Creek, it overlies the Avenal(?) Sandstone and is overlain by the Point of Rocks Sandstone, as at Devils Den; it is about 90 feet thick and is the same unit as the upper Lodo of Mallory (1959, p. 24, 45, figs. 3, 7), which he assigned to his Ulatisian Stage, middle Eocene.

The upper unit of the Kreyenhagen Shale in the Devils Den area is composed of about 600 feet of clayey shale that overlies the Point of Rocks Sandstone and is overlain by the Wagonwheel Formation. This shale unit was named Welcome Formation by Sandstone. The major part of the Kreyenhagen Van Couvering and Alien (1943, p. 496-500). This unit is herein adopted as the Welcome Shale Member of the Kreyenhagen Shale, with the type section designated as Welcome Valley (SE 1/4 sec. 35, T. 25 S., R. 18 E., NE*4NE14 sec. 2 and NWVi sec. 1, T. 26 S., R. 18 E.), just south of Devils Den. This unit is poorly and incompletely exposed; it is concealed by alluvium to the southeast and is overlapped by the Temblor Formation to the northwest. It forms the upper part of the type Narizian Stage, upper Eocene, of Mallory (1959, p. 55-56), although foraminifers of the Refugian Stage have been reported from the uppermost part of this shale unit by Smith (1956, p. 77-78) and Mallory (1959, p. 71).

On the basis of the foregoing evidence, the Gredal Shale Member of the Kreyenhagen Shale is assigned to the Ulatisian Stage, middle Eocene, and the Welcome Shale Member is assigned to the Narizian Stage, upper Eocene, with the upper part possibly extending into the Refugian Stage, early Oligocene.

Tpr,,Point of Rocks Sandstone (Eocene),"The sandstone of the Eocene sedimentary sequence is prominently exposed in the northwest part of the Temblor Range, where it is as much as 2,000 feet thick, near Devils Den where it is about 2,350 feet thick, and in the Diablo Range, where it is as much as 1,250 feet thick. In the Devils Den area, it was named Point of Rocks Sandstone, for Point of Rocks (S 1/2 sec. 2, T. 26 S., R. 18 E.), 3 miles south of Devils Den, by Van Couvering and Alien (1943, p. 496-500). This name is adopted herein. In the Reef Ridge area, this sandstone either is missing or may be represented by a sandstone lens as thick as 30 feet about 100 feet above the base of the Kreyenhagen Shale (Dickinson, 1966a, p. 711).

The Point of Rocks Sandstone rarely contains fossils. ""Characteristic Tejon fossils"" were reported but not listed from the Point of Rocks area by Arnold and Johnson (1910, p. 38). At Devils Den, the Point of Rocks Sandstone, with the possible exception of the lowest 75 feet, was designated as the type Narizian Stage, upper Eocene, by Mallory (1959, p. 55-56). Foraminifers diagnostic of the Narizian Stage were obtained from thin shale beds in this sandstone at Devils Den and also at Media Agua Creek by Mallory (1959, p. 56). At Devils Den, shale interbeds in the lowest 75 feet of the Point of Rocks Sandstone contain foraminifers assigned by Mallory (1959, p. 57) to the Ulatisian Stage. The basal part of the Point of Rocks Sandstone is thereby assigned to the Ulatisian Stage, middle Eocene, and the major part to the Narizian Stage, upper Eocene.

Ta,,Avenal Sandstone (Eocene),"In the Reef Ridge area, northwest of McLure Valley, the basal Tertiary sandstone unit was named Avenal Sandstone by Anderson (1905, p. 164, pi. 34, fig. 1) for Avenal wells in Big Tar Canyon, 6 miles southwest of Avenal (fig. 2). This sandstone was assigned to the Domengine Formation (of Anderson, 1905, north of Coalinga) by Clark (1929, p. 216) and Gester and Galloway (1933, p. 1167,1184). The Avenal Sandstone, which contains orbitoid Foraminifera and abundant mollusks, was mapped and described in detail by Stewart (1946, p. 89-94, pi. 1), who adopted the name and suggested its correlation with the Domengine Formation, which is very similar and is probably the same unit. The Avenal Sandstone is from 300 to 500 feet thick and fine grained, and it contains abundant mollusks assigned to the middle Eocene (Stewart, 1946, p. 92-94). It was questionably assigned to the Ulatisian Stage, middle Eocene, by Mallory (1959, p. 51, fig. 7).

In areas south and southeast of McLure Valley, the basal Tertiary sandstone discussed in the next three paragraphs is herein included in the Avenal Sandstone because of generally similar lithology and probably similar stratigraphic position. Local names have been applied to this sandstone because of uncertainty of its correlation with the type Avenal Sandstone.

In the Diablo Range west of McLure Valley, this basal sandstone is as thick as 400 feet and was called Acebedo Sandstone by Dickinson (1963, p. 48-52). This sandstone contains <(Spiroglyphus"" and orbitoid Foraminifera, and according to Mallory (1959, p. 50-51), it is slightly older than the type Avenal Sandstone and was assigned by him to the Ulatisian or Penutian Stage, middle or lower Eocene.

In the Devils Den area, the lowest Tertiary sandstone unit, as thick as 200 feet, contains ""Spiroglyphus"" (Rotularia) and was named Mabury Sandstone by Van Couvering and Alien (1943, p. 496-500). Mallory (1959, p. 37, fig. 7) assigned this sandstone to the Lodo Formation and to his Penutian Stage, lower Eocene.

In the Temblor Range between Media Agua and Carneros Creek, the lowest Tertiary sandstone unit forms a lens as thick as 300 feet. It is underlain by clay shale of the Lodo Formation and is overlain by the Gredal Shale Member of the Kreyenhagen Shale. According to Durham (1942, p. 503-510), this sandstone contains (in NE 1/3 SE 1/4 sec. 28, T. 28 S. R. 19 E., east of Media Agua Creek) mollusks and corals referred to the Domengine Stage, middle Eocene. However, at Media Agua Creek, where the sandstone unit is only 25 feet thick, Mallory (1959, p. 24, 34, fig. 7) designated the sandstone (his middle Lodo) and 20 feet of the underlying shale as his type Penutian Stage, lower Eocene; he correlated the sandstone, which there contains ""Spiroglyphus"" and orbitoid foraminifers, with the Mabury Sandstone of Devils Den and assigned both to the Lodo Formation.

This assignment is not adopted because at Media Agua Creek this 25-foot-thick ""sandstone reef"" is overlain by about 90 feet of clay shale which Mallory (1959, p. 30, fig. 3, 7) designated as upper Lodo but which he assigned to his Ulatisian Stage, middle Eocene. This assignment would correlate this shale with the Gredal Shale Member of the Kreyenhagen Shale. The underlying ""sandstone reef"" is therefore probably the same unit as the Avenal Sandstone, to which it is assigned.

Although there is some doubt as to exact correlation, the Acebedo Sandstone west of McLure Valley, Mabury Sandstone of Devils Den, and the sandstone at Media Agua Creek are herein assigned to the Avenal Sandstone because in each area they are of generally similar lithology and form the basal transgressive sandstone unit of the lower Tertiary marine sedimentary sequence; thus they appear to be the same unit. Therefore the local names Acebedo and Mabury are not formally adopted. The Avenal Sandstone, as herein mapped, is presumably in the Domengine molluscan age and Fenutian and Ulatisian Stages, early and middle Eocene.

Tus,,Unnamed sandstone (Eocene),
Tl,,Lodo Formation (Paleocene and Eocene),"On Media Agua Creek, in the Temblor Range, about 280 feet of rocks, predominantly clay shale, forms an interval between shale of the Panoche Formation and the Point of Rocks Sandstone. On the basis of microfaunas, this interval was correlated with and assigned by Mallory (1959, figs. 3, 7) to the Lodo Formation of White (1938) (type locality about 35 miles northwest of Coalinga) of Paleocene and early Eocene age. Mallory divided this interval into three units: lower, middle and upper Lodo.

The lower Lodo, as indicated by Mallory (1959, p. 25-26, 30-31, 34, figs. 3, 7), is about 160 feet thick at Media Agua Creek and is composed of soft clay shale. On the basis of microfaunas he assigned this unit to his Ynezian and Bulitian Stages, Paleocene, with the exception of the uppermost 20 feet, which, together with the overlying ""sandstone reef"" (his middle Lodo), he designated as his type Penutian Stage, early Eocene. These stages assigned to this 160-foot-thick clay shale unit correlate it with the type Lodo Formation, and its assignment to that formation is tentatively adopted. From Media Agua Creek this clay shale unit appears to extend south- eastward along strike for an unknown distance, through poor exposures, possibly as far as Carneros Creek or Salt Creek. Northwest of Media Agua Creek it laps out.

Mallory (1959, p. 28, 37, fig. 7) suggested that a similar shale unit underlying the Avenal (""Mabury"") Sandstone in the Devils Den area may be of Paleocene and early Eocene ages, and he assigned it to the Lodo Formation. Foraminifera suggestive of those ages have been reported from a thin shale unit above the Panoche Formation from several wells in the Devils Den area (H. C. Wagner and others, unpub. data).

Mallory's middle Lodo at Media Agua Creek is considered to be the Avenal Sandstone, and his upper Lodo the Gredal Shale Member of the Kreyenhagen Shale, for reasons discussed under ""Avenal Sandstone."" Their assignment to the Lodo Formation is therefore not adopted.

Tss,,"Sandstone, clay shale and minor conglomerate, marine clastic and sedimentary rocks (Eocene and Paleocene)","The marine clastic sedimentary rocks are a monotonous, continuously deposited series, as much as 30,000 feet thick, of interbedded arkosic sandstone, siltstone, clay shale, and granitic conglomerate. These strata appear to be deltaic deposits derived from rapid erosion of a nearby granitic terrane and deposited in a shallow sea. This thick series is not named nor differentiated into formations or members because it contains no persistent distinct lithologic units other than a basal conglomerate as thick as 2,000 feet which overlies granitic basement in the La Panza Range. The marine clastic sedimentary rocks, together with the granitic basement exposed in the La Panza Range, are overlain unconformably by the middle Tertiary sedimentary sequence.

This series of marine clastic sedimentary rocks rarely contains fossils. This sequence was formerly thought to be of Late Cretaceous age (Eaton and others, 1941, p. 213-214, fig. 3; Hill and others, 1958, p. 2997; Jennings, 1958); however, a few fossils diagnostic of Late Cretaceous age were found in the lowest 6,000 feet of this sequence in the La Panza Range from 21/& to 7 miles northwest of Pozo and in the basal 1,000 feet near Deadman Flat, 24 miles southeast of Pozo. A few mollusks and foraminifers considered to be of Paleocene age were found stratigraphically higher a few miles southeast of Pozo, and orbitoidal foraminifers diagnostic of early to middle Eocene age were found still higher in the section in the Sierra Madre Mountains (Vedder and Brown, 1968, p. 248-249). Just beyond the southeast border of figure 2, the highest part of this series yielded mollusks diagnostic of middle Eocene age (Vedder and Brown, 1968, p. 249-251).

At the southeast end of the Caliente Range (T. 10 N., R. 25 W.), is exposed about 3,000 feet of marine clastic sedimentary rocks which there were named the Pattiway Formation by Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958, p. 2977). This name is adopted herein for this unit but only for this exposure, and others beyond the southeast border of figure 2. In these exposures, the Pattiway Formation is composed of light-gray sandstone, gray silty shale, and a few thin conglomerate lenses. It is unconformably overlain by the Simmler Formation, and the base is not exposed.

Kp,,"Clay shale and claystone, Panoche Formation (Upper Cretaceous)","In the southeastern part of the Diablo Range, the Gravelly Flat Formation is overlain by as much as 7,500 feet of interbedded concretion-rich light-colored sandstone and dark-gray clay shale or claystone of Late Cretaceous age. The contact with the underlying Gravelly Flat Formation is gradational, but in places it is marked by lenses of conglomerate or sandstone.

These Upper Cretaceous strata were referred by Arnold and Johnson (1910, p. 35-37, pi. 1) to the Chico Formation (of Gabb, 1869), but were mapped as the major part of their undifferentiated ""Knoxville-Chico rocks."" In the Orchard Peak area southwest of McLure Valley, these strata were divided by Marsh (1960, p. 12-29, pis. 1, 2) into eight local units mapped as formations, including the uppermost claystone unit that he referred to the Moreno Formation of Anderson and Pack (1915). The names Marsh applied to these units are not adopted herein because the units are not recognizable outside that area. Farther northwest, all the Cretaceous marine sedimentary sequence was referred by Dickinson (1966a, p. 709-710) to the Panoche Group.

This series of strata, of Late Cretaceous age, is assigned to the Panoche Formation because it includes the major part of the series mapped as the Panoche Formation by Anderson and Pack (1915) and is lithologically distinct from the part assigned to the Gravelly Flat Formation. It is most practical to differentiate the Panoche Formation on the basis of lithology into units that are predominantly sandstone, units that are predominantly shale or claystone, and units that are predominantly conglomerate, as shown in figure 5. No names are applied herein because the lateral extent of these units is very limited.

The uppermost clay shale unit crops out on the west and south sides of McLure Valley, where it is about 900 feet thick and is overlain unconformably by Tertiary formations. On the south side of the valley, this clay shale unit was referred by Marsh (1960, p. 28-29, pi. 1) to the Moreno Formation of Anderson and Pack (1915, p. 46-47) on the basis of similar lithology and microfaunal correlation. This correlation is doubtful, however, because the Moreno Formation, of latest Cretaceous and Paleocene(?) age, overlies the Panoche Formation north of Coalinga but is overlapped by Tertiary formations south of Coalinga; moreover, it is not known to be present within the area of figure 2, either on the surface or in the subsurface (R. L. Pierce, oral commun., 1968).

In the northwestern Temblor Range, only the lowest 2,000 feet of the Panoche Formation is exposed. It lies unconformably below Tertiary formations, and its contact with the underlying Gravelly Flat Formation is gradational and arbitrarily
Jocated.

The Panoche Formation within the area of figure 2 contains scattered megafossils and microfossils diagnostic of Late Cretaceous age (Campanian and Maestrichtian Stages) (Marsh, 1960, p. 16, 21, 24, 25, 28, Orchard Peak area; Dickinson, 1966b, p. 464, Table Mountain area; D. L. Jones, oral commun., 1966, Cedar Creek area of northwest Temblor Range). In the Orchard Peak area, the upper half of the Panoche Formation is inferred from megafossils and microfossils to be mainly within the Campanian Stage, ranging into the Santonian and possibly into the lower Maestrichtian Stages (Marsh, 1960, p. 25, 28, 29). West of Reef Ridge the lowest shale unit of the Panoche Formation, about 7 miles southwest of Avenal, yielded an ammonite (found by Paul Enos) considered diagnostic of the Turonian Stage (D. L. Jones, oral commun., 1965).

This series of strata, of Late Cretaceous age, is assigned to the Panoche Formation because it includes the major part of the series mapped as the Panoche Formation by Anderson and Pack (1915) and is lithologically distinct from the part assigned to the Gravelly Flat Formation. It is most practical to differentiate the Panoche Formation on the basis of lithology into units that are predominantly sandstone, units that are predominantly shale or claystone, and units that are predominantly conglomerate, as shown in figure 5. No names are applied herein because the lateral extent of these units is very limited.

The uppermost clay shale unit crops out on the west and south sides of McLure Valley, where it is about 900 feet thick and is overlain unconformably by Tertiary formations. On the south side of the valley, this clay shale unit was referred by Marsh (1960, p. 28-29, pi. 1) to the Moreno Formation of Anderson and Pack (1915, p. 46-47) on the basis of similar lithology and microfaunal correlation. This correlation is doubtful, however, because the Moreno Formation, of latest Cretaceous and Paleocene(?) age, overlies the Panoche Formation north of Coalinga but is overlapped by Tertiary formations south of Coalinga; moreover, it is not known to be present within the area of figure 2, either on the surface or in the subsurface (R. L. Pierce, oral commun., 1968).

In the northwestern Temblor Range, only the lowest 2,000 feet of the Panoche Formation is exposed. It lies unconformably below Tertiary formations, and its contact with the underlying Gravelly Flat Formation is gradational and arbitrarily
Jocated.

The Panoche Formation within the area of figure 2 contains scattered megafossils and microfossils diagnostic of Late Cretaceous age (Campanian and Maestrichtian Stages) (Marsh, 1960, p. 16, 21, 24, 25, 28, Orchard Peak area; Dickinson, 1966b, p. 464, Table Mountain area; D. L. Jones, oral commun., 1966, Cedar Creek area of northwest Temblor Range). In the Orchard Peak area, the upper half of the Panoche Formation is inferred from megafossils and microfossils to be mainly within the Campanian Stage, ranging into the Santonian and possibly into the lower Maestrichtian Stages (Marsh, 1960, p. 25, 28, 29). West of Reef Ridge the lowest shale unit of the Panoche Formation, about 7 miles southwest of Avenal, yielded an ammonite (found by Paul Enos) considered diagnostic of the Turonian Stage (D. L. Jones, oral commun., 1965).

Kpg,,"Conglomerate, Panoche Formation (Upper Cretaceous)","In the southeastern part of the Diablo Range, the Gravelly Flat Formation is overlain by as much as 7,500 feet of interbedded concretion-rich light-colored sandstone and dark-gray clay shale or claystone of Late Cretaceous age. The contact with the underlying Gravelly Flat Formation is gradational, but in places it is marked by lenses of conglomerate or sandstone.

These Upper Cretaceous strata were referred by Arnold and Johnson (1910, p. 35-37, pi. 1) to the Chico Formation (of Gabb, 1869), but were mapped as the major part of their undifferentiated ""Knoxville-Chico rocks."" In the Orchard Peak area southwest of McLure Valley, these strata were divided by Marsh (1960, p. 12-29, pis. 1, 2) into eight local units mapped as formations, including the uppermost claystone unit that he referred to the Moreno Formation of Anderson and Pack (1915). The names Marsh applied to these units are not adopted herein because the units are not recognizable outside that area. Farther northwest, all the Cretaceous marine sedimentary sequence was referred by Dickinson (1966a, p. 709-710) to the Panoche Group.

Kh,,Hex Claystone (Lower Cretaceous),"Pervasively sheared gray claystone is exposed in two places, one southeast of Orchard Peak, the other west of Devils Den. In the former exposure it was named Hex Formation by Marsh (1960, p. 6-7). The type locality was designated at Hex Hill, about 6 miles east-southeast of Orchard Peak. This name is adopted herein for this unusual formation, but is modified to Hex Claystone because of its nearly homogeneous claystone lithology.

The stratigraphic position of the Hex Claystone is not definitely known because (1) it is pervasively sheared, (2) it is bounded by faults, (3) it appears to have been injected as a plastic mass between faults into the Panoche Formation at Hex Hill and even into Tertiary rocks at Devils Den, and (4) it is lithologically similar to the claystone or clay shale of the Panoche Formation, but contains fossils diagnostic of pre-Late Cretaceous age.

Marsh (1960, p. 6-7) considered his Hex Formamion to be of Late Jurassic (?) age on the basis of marine fossils found in the Hex and to be older than his Badger Shale (Gravelly Flat Formation of this report), which he assigned to the Early Cretaceous(?). While it is possible that the Hex Claystone may have been injected from below the Gravelly Flat Formation, this is considered unlikely because no claystone has been found in that position in an unfaulted section. Structural evidence revealed from mapping on Hex Hill (Dibblee, 1972a) suggests that the Hex Claystone formed by pervasive shearing of the upper part of the Gravelly Flat Formation, possibly with some involvement of the Panoche Formation.

Belemnites and foraminifers from the Hex Claystone of the Hex Hill area have been considered suggestive of Late Jurassic, Early Cretaceous, or Late Cretaceous ages, and the formation was tentatively assigned a Late Jurassic (?) age (Marsh, 1960, p. 8). Foraminifers from both the Hex Hill and Devils Den exposures are now, however, considered strongly suggestive of an Early Cretaceous (Valanginian) age (Church, 1968, p. 527). This age is also suggested from Buchia species found at both exposures (D. L. Jones, oral commun., 1970).

jo,,"Mostly shale, Jollo Formation (Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous)",
gf,,"Mostly shale, Gravelly Flat Formation (Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous)","The lowest unit of the Jurassic (?) and Cretaceous marine sedimentary sequence is prominentlyexposed in the southeastern part of the Diablo Range, where it consists of about 3,000 feet of thin-bedded dark shale containing thin interbeds of brown-weathering sandstone. On the southwest slope of Orchard Peak, this unit was originally referred to by Arnold and Johnson (1910, p. 351, pi. 1) as the Knoxville Formation (of Diller and Stanton, 1894), but was mapped as part of the undifferentiated ""Knoxville-Chico rocks."" It was later named Badger Shale by Marsh (1960, p. 9-12). Farther northwest, near Parkfield (10 miles northwest of Cholame (fig. 1)), this shale unit was mapped as the lower and middle parts of the Panoche Group by Dickinson (1966a, p. 709-710, pis. 1,2; 1966b, p. 461-462, pi. 1). Still farther northwest, near Gravelly Flat east of Priest Valley (about 38 miles northwest of Cholame or 16 miles west-northwest of Coalinga (fig. 1)), this shale unit contains Buchia and was named Gravelly Flat Formation by Rose and Colburn (1963, p. 41).

Regional mapping within and northwest of the area of figure 2 reveals that this shale unit is recognizable in various parts of the Diablo Range and commonly contains Buchia. It would be appropriate to apply one name to this unit throughout its recognizable areal extent, but unfortunately different names have been applied to it in different areas. A type exposure should be one that is fossiliferous and structurally homoclinal with the top and base exposed; the exposure that best meets these requirements is the one east of Priest Valley. Here this unit was named by Rose and Colburn (1963, p. 41) as the Gravelly Flat Formation. Therefore this name is hereby applied to the lowest mappable commonly Buchia-bearing predominantly shale unit of the Jurassic(?) and Cretaceous marine sedimentary sequence within and northwest of the area of figure 2.

The type section of the Gravelly Flat Formation was not designated by Rose and Colburn (1963), although they mapped the exposure of this unit southeast of Gravelly Flat. From Gravelly Flat this unit was traced farther northwest by the writer, and type section is here designated as the spur extending southwest from Center Peak in the SW 1/4 sec. 12 and NW*4 sec. 13, T. 20 S., R. 12 E., about 3 miles northwest of Gravelly Flat (Priest Valley 15' quad.) and about 16 miles west-northwest of Coalinga (fig. 1). There the Gravelly Flat Formation is about 2,400 feet thick. It is composed mainly of dark shale, including about 400 feet of brown-weather sandstonr in the lowest part, in contact with serpentine at the base. The shale is confirmably overlain by a thick conglomerate unit herein assigned to the base of the Panoche Formation.

According to Rose and Colburn (1963, p. 41) and D. L. Jones (oral commun., 1970), the lowest part of the Gravelly Flat Formation east of Priest Valley contains Buchia piochii, generally considered diagnostic of Late Jurassic (Tithonian) age; the middle part contains Buchia crassa, diagnostic of Early Cretaceous (Valanginian) age; and the upper part contains fossils suggestive of Early Cretaceous (Hauterivian) age.

In its exposure east of Priest Valley and also within the area of figure 2, the Gravelly Flat Formation is distinguishable from the overlying Panoche Formation by its dark-gray to olive-brown color, the dark-colored graywacke character of its sandstone interbeds, and a lack of thick light-colored sandstone beds. Within the area of figure 2 on the south and west slopes of Orchard Peak, where the unit herein referred to the Gravelly Flat Formation was mapped by Marsh (1960, p. 9-12, pi. 1) as the Badger Shale, the formation is about 3,700 feet thick, it contains two layers of tuff or bentonite, and its base is partly if not entirely in fault contact with serpentine. North of Orchard Peak this unit is either depositional on or in fault contact with the Franciscan rocks. It yielded no diagnostic fossils in any of these exposures, but is assigned to the Gravelly Flat Formation because it is lithologically similar to and occupies the same stratigraphic position as the type section. It is tentatively considered to be of the same age, but because of the absence of fossils, the Jurassic assignment is queried.

In the northwestern Temblor Range the Gravelly Flat Formation is lithologically similar to the unit in the Diablo Range, and no fossils were found. It may be over 5,000 feet thick, but its contact with shale of the overlying Panoche Formation is only arbitrarily placed at the lowest abundantly interbedded sandstones.
