Tcb,Central and western Santa Monica Mountains (below Malibu Bowl Detachment Fault),"Calabasas Formation, undivided (early late Miocene and late middle Miocene)","Interbedded impure, clayey to silty sandstone and silty shale, containing local beds of sedimentary breccia; sandstone is thin-, medium- and thick-bedded, mostly medium to coarse grained, poorly sorted, commonly having wacke texture, commonly shows graded bedding. Shale, locally diatomaceous or phosphatic, locally abundant fish scales, sparse foraminifera, and rust-colored plant casts. Some thicker beds contain zones of large ovoid dolomitic concretions; sedimentary breccia, olistostromes incorporating cobble- to large boulder-size clasts of recognizable older Tertiary strata, including fossil-bearing clasts of Paleocene, Eocene, early Miocene, and middle Miocene strata, as well as volcanic (probable Conejo Volcanics) clasts. Many sandstone beds are lithologically similar to those in overlying, less-deformed Modelo Formation.  16 Modelo is generally unconformable over Calabasas. West of Malibu Junction and north of Ventura Freeway the two formations are accordant; Calabasas grades westward into finer-grained clayey siltstone and shale much like nearby Modelo; two formations are distinguished only by differences in foraminiferal fauna. (Calabasas there contains foraminifera referred to Luisian Stage of Kleinpell, 1938; Modelo contains foraminifera referred to Mohnian Stage of Kleinpell, 1938. Many foram collections from the Calabasas are not diagnostic as to Stage, and have been reported only as middle Miocene, Relizian or Luisian.) The name is taken from Calabasas Peak, about 3 km east of prominent exposures of Calabasas strata in Stokes Canyon-McCoy Canyon area (Yerkes and Campbell, 1979). Along north flank of Santa Monica Mountains, south of Ventura Freeway (U.S. 101), contact relationships with the underlying Conejo Volcanics are marked by extreme variability, apparently reflecting nearly continuous marine sedimentation, intermittently overwhelmed by episodes of waning submarine volcanic activity, punctuated by episodes of structural disturbance that may have included detachment faulting. Consequently, just east of Medea Creek and south of Agoura (northeast Point Dume 7.5’ quadrangle, southeast Thousand Oaks 7.5’ quadrangle) Calabasas lies unconformably across one sequence of volcanic strata, yet nearby to east and west base is accordant with different levels in volcanic sequence (Blackerby, 1965). West of Westlake, persistent volcanic conglomerate assigned to Calabasas lies unconformably across Boney Mountain Fault and Conejo Volcanics to west (Weber, 1984). Similar volcanic conglomerate along south and west flanks of Simi Hills intervenes between overlying Modelo Formation and north dipping Cretaceous and early Tertiary strata, and has also been assigned to Calabasas Formation (Weber, 1984)",sandstone

Thickest (probably in excess of 3 km) where it underlies north flank of western Santa Monica Mountains, and thinning eastward to as little as 200 m of interbedded flows and volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks on nose of Topanga Anticline. Further east volcanic rocks are relatively thin and discontinuous, and name has not been extended eastward for more than a mile east of Topanga Canyon Road. Thick sequence shows crude compositional layering: pillow basalt, pillow breccia, aquagene tuff, black volcanic sandstone and interbedded black siltstone are common in basal part of Conejo, associated with basalt, andesitic basalt, and basaltic andesite flows, breccia, and agglomerate. Andesite and basaltic andesite predominate in the central part of sequence with interlayered andesitic basalt. Sequence has upper zone, dominated by andesite and basaltic andesite but includes dacite flows in some areas as well as epiclastic volcanic conglomerates containing andesite and dacite clasts. Durrell (1954) recognized general extent of volcanics that intervene between lower- and upper-middle Miocene sedimentary strata, and called them “Middle Topanga Formation”; but name ""Conejo Volcanics"" applied by Taliaferro (1924) to rocks in Conejo Mountain area has precedence; adopted by Blackerby (1965) and by Yerkes and Campbell (1979). Basal Conejo is conformable on and interbedded with upper part of underlying Topanga Canyon Formation from about one mile west of Malibu Lake, eastward to area north of Calabasas Peak. Westward, in western part of Point Dume 7.5’ quadrangle and eastern part of Triunfo Pass 7.5’ quadrangle, contact lies unconformably across Topanga Canyon and Vaqueros strata. Unconformable parts of contact do not require an episode of uplift and erosion; we interpret missing strata as probably removed by faulting, perhaps associated with caldera collapse, leaving a downdropped surface that was backfilled by a sequence of eruptive episodes. Weigand and Savage (1993) have summarized geochemistry of Conejo Volcanics, comparing units with other southern California Miocene volcanic suites. Range in initial Sr87/Sr86 is reported as 0.70294-0.704201, indicating parent magmas derived from upper mantle without important crustal rock contamination (Weigand and Savage, 1993, p. 105,106). K-Ar ages on plagioclase from basalt and andesite, reported by Turner and Campbell (1979), range from 15.5+0.8 Ma near the base of the Conejo to 13.9+0.4 Ma near the top. McCulloh and others (2002, p. 3) have recalculated older date using updated decay constants to yield 15.9+0.8 Ma age ",

West of there it becomes accordant with (and apparently conformable on) subjacent strata of Calabasas Formation (Weber, 1984); further west, Modelo and subjacent parts of Calabasas appear to grade progressively westward into more diatomaceous, clayey, Monterey-like lithofacies. Many sandstone and shale beds below unconformity and its westward conformable extension and above Conejo Volcanics are lithologically similar to Modelo but more intensely folded and faulted; these beds have been assigned to Calabasas Formation by Yerkes and Campbell (1979). Fellbaum and Fritsche (1993) include them in Modelo Formation; however, their correlation with Mohnian age strata above unconformity is unlikely.

Encinal siltstone rests conformably on sandstone of underlying San Nicholas Member of Vaqueros Formation, but there is apparent discordance in some places. Encinal member is unconformably overlain by Conejo Volcanics, though missing strata may not have been removed by subaerial erosion (see discussion of base of Conejo, above). Poorly preserved foraminifera in two collections from Encinal Canyon Road exposures are assigned to Relizian (?) Stage and Saucesian or Relizian stages of Kleinpell (1938), respectively (Yerkes and Campbell 1979). Sonneman (1956) reports equivalent strata farther west  20 contained foraminifera assignable to Relizian Stage. Subsequent collection is also assigned a late Saucesian to early Relizian age (Flack 1993). Flack (1993, p. 46) considers Encinal Member, as well as entire Topanga Canyon Formation, to be late early Miocene rather than early middle Miocene. On basis of age and lithologic similarity, Fritsche (1993, p. 9-10) proposed Encinal Member should be considered a tongue of Rincon Formation (early Miocene; Zemorrian and Saucesian Stages) of northern Ventura Basin. Because parts of the Encinal Member are probably Relizian, and major structural features, largely concealed by younger strata, intervene between northern and southern parts of western Transverse Ranges, extension of name, Rincon Formation to Santa Monica Mountains seems questionable, and the usage of source maps is retained.

Tvd,Central and western Santa Monica Mountains (below Malibu Bowl Detachment Fault),"Vaqueros Formation, Danielson Member (early Miocene)","Grayish black, very fine-grained, marine sandy siltstone or mudstone, in medium and thin beds, generally having indistinct parallel lamination; fractures commonly conchoidal or irregularly subparallel to bedding, but locally platy or shaly. In San Nicholas Canyon, several prominent interbeds, 1/3 to 1 m thick, of calcareous very fine-grained sandstone and sandy mudstone contain Turritella inezana Conrad in such numbers as to locally form biostromes (Yerkes and Campbell, 1979, p. E12). Mapped as “Danielson Formation” by Sonneman (1956) named for exposures on Danielson Ranch in Big Sycamore Canyon (Triunfo Pass 7.5’ quadrangle); formalized as member of Vaqueros Formation by Yerkes and Campbell (1979).  22 (Triunfo Pass and Point Dume 7.5’ quadrangles; Sonneman, 1956; Campbell and others, 1996; Campbell, unpublished 1:12,000-scale mapping, 1967-1975)",
Tvn,Central and western Santa Monica Mountains (below Malibu Bowl Detachment Fault),"Vaqueros Formation, San Nicholas Member (early Miocene)","Very thick bedded to massive cliff- and ledge-forming marine sandstone, generally very light gray to pale bluish gray; rare interbeds and partings of siltstone and shale, commonly dark gray. Sandstone, very fine- to very coarse-grained arenite, locally pebbly; thick beds show internal cross lamination, parallel lamination, and disturbed (burrowed?) laminations; local abundant barnacle detritus. Generally conformably underlain by Danielson Member of the Vaqueros Formation; however, locally thinned where it rests on older rocks beneath Zuma Detachment Fault, as in Encinal Canyon. Conformably overlain by Encinal Member of Topanga Canyon Formation. Mapped as “Nicholas Formation” by Sonneman (1956) named for exposures in vicinity of San Nicholas Canyon (Triunfo Pass 7.5’ quadrangle); formalized as member of Vaqueros Formation by Yerkes and Campbell (1979).

Tz,,Zuma Volcanics (early? and middle Miocene),"Basaltic, andesitic and dacitic flows, flow breccia, pillow lava, aquagene tuff, mudflow breccia, volcanic sand and interbedded mudstone, siltstone, sandstone, and minor breccia-conglomerate. All probably deposited in marine environment. No igneous rocks south of Malibu Coast Fault are recognizably intrusive into associated sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary interbeds carry foraminifera referred to Relizian or Luisian Stages (middle Miocene) of Kleinpell (1938). Most samples of Zuma Volcanics (Weigand and Savage, 1993) are in dacite field of the classification of LeBas and others (1986). Plagioclase phenocrysts from basalt near tip of Point Dume have been dated at 14.6 + 1 Ma (Berry and others, 1976). Base not exposed, but equivalent section in exploratory well, Sovereign Malibu 1 on Point Dume, is about 430 m (stratigraphic) thick above probable metamorphic basement (Catalina Schist).
