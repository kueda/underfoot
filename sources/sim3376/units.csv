Tw4,,"Wild Horse Mesa Tuff, Unit 4 (Miocene)","Cliff-forming ash-flow tuff that forms summit of hill 1432T; top eroded; consists of upper, middle, and lower subunits about 8, 2, and 10 m thick, respectively. Upper subunit is a distinctive, dark-brown-weathering welded tuff characterized by abundant lenticular, crystallized pumice clasts and weathering pits mostly ≤2 cm long; a fine-grained, crystalline groundmass encloses scattered sanidine crystals ~1 mm long. Middle subunit consists of dense, dark-gray welded tuff containing sparse sanidine crystals ≤1 mm long and abundant small, highly flattened felsite clasts in a fine-grained crystalline groundmass with relict vitroclastic texture. Lower subunit consists of 10 m of light-brownish-gray welded tuff that contains elongate, dark-brown pumice fragments ≤2 cm long, light-gray lithic fragments ≤3 mm long, and scattered sanidine crystals.

Sanidine crystals are present in some pumice clasts. Strongly lithified, spherical to ovoid concretions of similar composition to host rock are locally abundant near base of unit. A representative sample of unit contains ~73.5 percent SiO2, 10.1 percent K2O + Na2O, and 0.20 percent TiO2.

Tw2u,,"Wild Horse Mesa Tuff, Unit 2, Unwelded facies (Miocene)","Light-brown to light-pinkish-brown, massive, low-density tuff characterized by abundant reddish-brown pumice fragments mostly ≤1 cm long. Pumice fragments are mostly oblong but do not appear to be highly flattened. As seen in thin section, both the pumice fragments and the enclosing groundmass are isotropic (glassy); the groundmass displays an unwelded vitroclastic texture with well-preserved shards. Including pumice fragments, sand-size and larger clasts typically make up ~30–40 percent of the rock volume; clasts include free crystals (mostly sanidine), felsic volcanic rock fragments, and rare granitic rock fragments. Four samples contain ~73–75 percent SiO2, 8.6–9.7 percent K2O + Na2O, and 0.16–0.20 percent TiO2",
Tw2w,,"Wild Horse Mesa Tuff, Unit 2, Welded facies (Miocene)","Pink to brown, strongly lithified, cliff-forming, welded tuff containing 30–50 percent sand-size and larger clasts floating in a fine-grained groundmass. Clasts include pumice fragments, crystals, and rare lithoclasts. Pumice fragments are elongate, dark brown to purplish brown, and ≤3 cm long and 1 cm thick; most are flattened and aligned with stratification. The pumice fragments are crystallized and some are spherulitic. Crystals are almost all anhedral to subhedral sanidine ≤2 mm in diameter; biotite and plagioclase crystals are rare. Some plagioclase crystals are sericitized and probably were reworked from older rocks. Lithoclasts are mostly fine-grained volcanic(?) rocks; one granitic rock fragment containing microcline was observed. The glassy to finely crystalline groundmass contains crystallized shards and small pumice fragments that are strongly flattened and commonly bent around adjacent crystals. Base of unit is marked by a distinctive, lightyellowish-brown, unwelded to weakly welded tuff that has well-developed columnar jointing and forms a continuous ledge about 2 m high; this rock contains 30–40 percent sand-size and larger clasts including orange pumice fragments as much as 7 mm long, felsic volcanic and minor fine-grained granitic lithoclasts as much as 4 mm long, and sanidine crystals in a glassy groundmass containing abundant yellowish-brown, crystallized shards.

Pumice clasts have form ratios ≤3:1 but do not appear to be significantly flattened. In many places, the tuff also contains abundant volcanic and granitic lithoclasts ≤4 cm long; the dominant clasts in one sample are glassy to felsitic volcanic rocks, some of which contain well-preserved shards that strongly suggest a Cenozoic source-rock age. Seven samples contain ~73–75 percent SiO2, 7.4–9.8 percent K2O + Na2O, and 0.15–0.21 percent TiO2. Maximum thickness ~40 m",
Tp,,Peach Spring Tuff (Miocene),"Light-gray to pinkish-gray, purplish-gray, and pink, cliff-forming ash-flow tuff correlated with the regionally extensive Peach Spring Tuff of Young (in Billingsley and others, 1999; formerly Peach Springs Tuff of Young and Brennan, 1974). Unit forms small, isolated outcrops in map area but is more continuously exposed in adjacent areas to the north and east (McCurry, 1985, 1988; Wells and Hillhouse, 1989; Buesch, 1991; Miller and others, 2007). In map area, unit primarily consists of welded tuff that contains elongate brown, crystallized pumice fragments ≤3 cm long and ~20 percent crystals ≤3 mm long (abundant sanidine, subordinate plagioclase and biotite, and rare but conspicuous sphene); the groundmass varies from glassy to felsitic and commonly has a well-preserved to relict vitroclastic texture with welded and compacted shards. Parts of unit show less evidence of welding and compaction. Nineteen samples contain ~72–79 percent SiO2, 7.6–9.6 percent K2O + Na2O, and 0.20–0.30 percent TiO2; the relatively high titanium content relative to SiO2 helps distinguish this unit from units 1–3 of the Wild Horse Mesa Tuff.

Jdd,,Diabase dikes (Jurassic?),"Fine-grained diabase dikes 2 to 5 m thick that cut Cambrian rocks in northern part of map area, particularly the Cadiz Formation. Dikes strike easterly, approximately parallel to the strike of the host rocks. One dike cuts a felsic dike of unit Jdf. Undated",
Jdf,,Felsic to intermediate dikes (Jurassic),"Dikes of diverse composition and lithology that cut rocks of Jurassic and older age. Most mapped dikes are 5 to 20 m thick, 0.2 to 3 km long, and strike northwest to northeast; many unmapped, smaller dikes are also present. Dike rocks are variably light to dark shades of gray, brown, brownish gray, greenish gray, red, reddish gray, and reddish brown in color. Most dikes are porphyritic, containing 5–30 percent euhedral to subhedral phenocrysts of plagioclase and potassium feldspar 2–10 mm long in a fine-grained crystalline groundmass; some of the more felsic dikes also contain subequant quartz phenocrysts <1–4 mm in diameter. Mafic phenocrysts, primarily biotite, are uncommon to rare. Chemical composition of 24 samples varies from rhyolite (17 samples, ~70–78 percent SiO2 and ~8– 12 percent K2O + Na2O) to trachyte and (or) trachydacite (5 samples, ~61–66 percent SiO2 and ~9–11 percent K2O + Na2O) to trachyandesite and basaltic trachyandesite (2 samples, ~56 percent SiO2 and ~7–8 percent K2O + Na2O). The most silicic dikes are chemically similar to rhyolite of unit Jfr; dikes near the margins of unit Jfr probably are genetically related to that unit. The most mafic, dark-colored dikes are either uniformly fine-grained or contain scattered phenocrysts of light-red plagioclase; many small, unmapped dikes of this type cut Jurassic plutonic rocks (unit Jg) in southern part of map area. Unit age is interpreted as late Middle to early Late Jurassic based on U-Pb zircon ages of 162.4±1.1 Ma for a red rhyolite dike (sample 12-PR-3888) that cuts the quartz monzonite of Goldstone (unit Jg) and the Fountain Peak Rhyolite (unit Jfr) in southeastern part of map area and 165.9±2.4 Ma for a light-pinkish-gray rhyolite dike (sample 14-PR-5023) that cuts the monzogranite of Tough Nut Spring (unit Jt) a short distance north of map area ",

Composed of subequal amounts of potassium feldspar (pink, red, and reddish gray), plagioclase (white, partly to almost completely sericitized), and quartz, 5–10 percent biotite (partly replaced by chlorite), and <5 percent iron oxides; potassium feldspar commonly forms phenocrysts <1 to 2 cm long. Average grain size, excluding phenocrysts, is ~3 mm. Two representative samples from fresh outcrops contain ~70 percent SiO2 and ~8 percent K2O + Na2O; weathered samples are of more varied chemical composition.

Jg,,"Quartz monzonite of Goldstone, Undivided rocks (Jurassic)","Primarily quartz monzonite and monzonite characterized by extensive sodium metasomatism (albitization) (Fox and Miller, 1990). Rocks are mostly medium grained (average grain size 2–3 mm), equigranular to weakly porphyritic, and range from weakly altered to completely albitized. Unweathered, weakly altered rocks typically are pinkish gray and consist of 25–35 percent each of pink to reddish-gray potassium feldspar and white to light-greenish-gray plagioclase, 5–15 percent quartz, 15–30 percent mafic minerals (hornblende > biotite > pyroxene), and 1–5 percent iron oxides. Plagioclase is weakly to strongly sericitized and commonly forms euhedral to subhedral phenocrysts 4–6 mm long; mafic minerals are partially replaced by chlorite in most samples but generally retain a dark color. Outcrops range from bold and resistant to highly weathered and recessive; weathered outcrops typically are dark brown with small white spots formed by plagioclase phenocrysts. Strongly to completely albitized rocks, by contrast, are white to light gray due to depletion of potassium feldspar and intense bleaching and alteration of the mafic minerals. In many samples, stained slabs and thin sections show that all the feldspar in these altered rocks is plagioclase, much of which is presumably albite formed by alteration of potassium feldspar. Chlorite and epidote are common, presumably as replacements of mafic minerals. The albitized rocks form resistant outcrops that range from large, irregular masses with indistinct boundaries to small dikes that cut sharply across less altered rocks. Chemically, 17 samples of weakly to completely altered rocks from this unit contain ~57–67 percent SiO2 and ~5–10 percent K2O + Na2O; all but two of these have ~6–9 percent K2O + Na2O. On this basis, most of the rocks are classified as quartz monzonite and monzonite; a few are diorite, granodiorite, and syenite. Granite probably also is present in small amounts, although none was chemically analyzed. Chemical analysis also shows that the albitized rocks are enriched in sodium (>4.7 percent Na2O) and depleted in potassium (<1.5 percent K2O) as a result of metasomatism",

Average grain size 2–3 mm. Plagioclase, which is strongly sericitized, commonly forms anhedral to euhedral phenocrysts as much as 6 mm long; mafic minerals are biotite and subordinate hornblende. No albitic alteration noted. Unit is characterized by its distinctive rock color, which is largely due to the abundance of unaltered red potassium feldspar.

Average grain size in equigranular rocks is 2–4 mm. Porphyritic rocks typically contain as much as 30 percent red potassium feldspar phenocrysts 5–20 mm long; some samples contain plagioclase phenocrysts generally ≤5 mm long. By contrast, strongly to completely albitized rocks typically are composed of 60– 70 percent plagioclase, 20–30 percent quartz, and 5–10 percent altered biotite or chlorite. Eight representative samples of unit have ~68–76 percent SiO2 and ~7.5–9 percent K2O + Na2O; of these, one strongly albitized sample is enriched in sodium (7.4 percent Na2O) and depleted in potassium (0.8 percent K2O) as a result of metasomatism.

Jgr,,"Quartz monzonite of Goldstone, Altered reddish-brown granitic rocks— (Jurassic)","Distinctive zones of altered, deeply weathered, reddish-brown granitic rocks south of Vulcan Mine and west of Goldstone Spring. Rocks are highly fractured, medium-grained (2–4 mm), quartz-rich granitoids characterized by abundant veinlets and irregular masses of altered biotite and chlorite; some rocks contain no potassium feldspar, presumably because of albitization. Four representative samples contain ~68 to 73 percent SiO2 and ~5–9 percent K2O + Na2O; one of these, which lacks potassium feldspar, is enriched in sodium (~6 percent Na2O) and depleted in potassium (0.4 percent K2O) as a result of metasomatism. In many places the altered granitic rocks are cut by small, dark-colored dikes that have not been separately mapped; the alteration of the granitic rocks may be related to intrusion of these dikes. Together, the altered granitic rocks and associated dikes form two narrow, north-trending, recessive outcrop bands surrounded by the more resistant granitoid outcrops of unit Jg; both outcrop bands are offset by east- to northeast-striking, left-lateral strike-slip faults.

Jfr,,Fountain Peak Rhyolite (Jurassic),"Massive, microcrystalline rhyolite that forms resistant outcrops along crest and slopes of Providence Mountains in vicinity of Fountain Peak and Edgar Peak. Dominant rock type is aphanitic to porphyritic rhyolite that varies in color from dark reddish brown and dark reddish purple to light gray, light yellowish gray, and light brownish gray. The rhyolite commonly contains 5– 10 percent feldspar phenocrysts (mainly plagioclase) <1 mm to 3 mm long; such phenocrysts rarely form as much as 30 percent of the rock volume. This rhyolite varies from featureless to strongly flow banded, with flow banding ranging from planar to contorted. Less abundant is massive rhyolite that contains scattered to abundant volcanic lithoclasts mostly 1–2 cm but locally as much as 30 cm in maximum dimension; some highly flattened lithoclasts are probably altered pumice fragments. These rocks, which are interpreted to have originated as tuff and welded tuff, are most common in eastern part of outcrop area. Chemically, 15 samples from various parts of unit are all rhyolite having ~70–78 percent SiO2 and ~9–11 percent total alkalis; only one of these has less than ~74 percent SiO2. Unit is interpreted to contain both intrusive and extrusive components as originally recognized by Hazzard (1954). Rhyolite in western part of outcrop area, including the narrow northern end, cuts across and intrudes adjacent sedimentary units (Pb, ms, ml, Jfs) and is interpreted to represent the feeder system of an extrusive dome represented by rhyolite to the east that is in close spatial association with tuffaceous and sedimentary rocks. Extrusive rocks presumably were once present west of feeder system as well, but later removed by erosion",
Jfs,,"Fountain Peak Rhyolite, Sandstone, conglomerate, and tuff (Jurassic)","Lenticular sequences of well-bedded clastic rocks below and within rhyolite of unit Jfr.

Some outcrops are fault bounded. Dominant rock type is maroon to brown, fine- to coarse-grained, arkosic to volcanic-lithic sandstone composed primarily of detrital feldspar, felsic volcanic grains, and quartz; feldspar grains are commonly subhedral to nearly euhedral, implying little reworking prior to deposition; very fine grained quartz sand and silt are common in the matrix of some coarse-grained sandstones. Many beds display size-sorted, planar lamination. Associated conglomeratic rocks contain granules to small pebbles of volcanic rocks (primarily felsic but also some dark clasts), sandstone, and limestone. South of Crystal Spring on east side of the Providence Mountains, unit is composed primarily of felsic tuff and tuffaceous sandstone, including distinctive green, well-bedded rocks in which diverse, poorly sorted, angular to subangular clasts ranging from fine sand size to 3 mm in diameter are enclosed in a finegrained felsitic matrix or groundmass; clasts include feldspar, quartz, and finegrained volcanic and sedimentary lithic fragments. Identical green tuffaceous rocks also form a Quaternary landslide mass downslope of these outcrops. North of Foshay Pass, basal part of unit locally consists of dark-brown, porphyritic andesite that directly overlies Moenkopi Formation; this andesite is overlain by light-gray felsic tuff that is overlain in turn by conglomeratic sandstone.

Carbonate rocks are metamorphosed to marble near plutonic rocks (unit Jg) in southern part of map area. Formation is broadly divisible into upper, middle, and lower parts of approximately equal thickness. Upper part is composed primarily of light-gray, thin- to medium-bedded dolomite and dolomitic limestone that contain irregular, popcorn-shaped, light-gray chert nodules; light- to medium-gray limestone and grayish-orange silty limestone to calcareous siltstone are subordinate. Middle part is composed primarily of light- to medium-gray, thin- to thick-bedded and massive limestone and subordinate grayish-orange silty limestone to calcareous siltstone; marine fossils including fusulinids, solitary corals, and colonial corals are locally abundant (Thompson and Hazzard, 1946; Wilson, 1994; Stevens and Stone, 2007). Lower part is composed of medium- to darkgray, thick-bedded to massive limestone that commonly contains abundant lenses and nodules of dark-brown chert, including rare spherical to subspherical nodules (“golf ball chert”). Conodonts from middle and lower parts of formation were described by Law (1969). Basal 20 m of formation locally consists of dark-gray, thin-bedded limestone that contains brown, irregularly shaped, phosphatic nodules like those observed at the same stratigraphic position in the Ship Mountains 55 km to the southeast (Stone and others, 2013). Contact with underlying Monte Cristo Limestone is commonly difficult to locate precisely, especially where the dark-gray Yellowpine Member is present; mapped contact was mainly interpreted from aerial photographs based on the geomorphic distinction between the cliff-forming Monte Cristo Limestone and the ledge-and-slope-forming Bird Spring Formation.

This unit is absent or unrecognizable at many localities and may be lenticular. Bullion Member, about 100 m thick, consists of light-gray, massive, cliff-forming limestone and minor dolomite containing lenses and nodules of cream-colored chert. Anchor Member, about 70 m thick, consists of light- to dark-gray limestone and minor dolomite containing abundant layers and lenses of brown chert 5–10 cm thick; chert makes up as much as ~40 percent of this unit. Limestone typically becomes lighter in color from bottom to top within the Anchor Member; upper and lower contacts are gradational. Dawn Member, about 70 m thick, consists primarily of medium- to dark-gray limestone that locally contains solitary corals, coarse crinoid debris, and other marine fossil material. Base of member and formation is herein placed at base of a 7-m-thick layer of brownish-gray, sandy dolomite that sharply overlies orthoquartzite mapped as the uppermost part of the Sultan Limestone (unit Dl); this sandy dolomite is overlain by 25 m of light-gray, thick-bedded, fine-grained limestone, which in turn is overlain by medium-gray dolomite that grades upward into typical medium- to darkgray limestone of the Dawn Member.

Upper half of unit, equivalent to Crystal Pass Member of the Sultan Limestone (Hazzard, 1954), consists primarily of light-gray, light-yellowish-gray, and light-bluish-gray, medium- to thick-bedded, laminated, very fine grained limestone. Late Devonian (Famennian) conodonts were reported in these rocks by Miller (1983). As mapped herein, upper 5 m locally consists of light-gray, medium-grained orthoquartzite that may correlate with the Late Devonian Quartz Spring Member of the Lost Burro Formation of Langenheim and Tischler (1960); in contrast, Hazzard (1954) mapped this orthoquartzite as the basal part of the overlying Monte Cristo Limestone. Lower half of unit, equivalent to upper part of the Valentine Member of the Sultan Formation (Hazzard, 1954), consists primarily of lightto dark-gray, thick-bedded to massive limestone and dolomite, along with minor silty to sandy dolomite and light-gray orthoquartzite. Limestone generally is more abundant than dolomite, although dolomite predominates in some areas. Stromatoporoids are abundant in several limestone and dolomite beds; corals, brachiopods, and gastropods are also present. Late Devonian (Frasnian) conodonts and brachiopods were reported by Miller (1983). Lower 20 m of unit typically consists of massive, light-gray limestone or dolomite overlain by a prominent bed of dark-gray limestone or dolomite 1–2 m thick containing abundant stromatoporoids; these rocks sharply overlie the slopeforming, thinner bedded rocks in the upper part of unit Dd. This prominent lower contact is the most consistent and readily mapped break in the stratigraphic sequence between the Dunderberg Shale and Monte Cristo Limestone. Unit thickness generally ~230 m, but locally as little as ~135 m (see cross section B-B′) owing to abrupt lateral thinning of the lower part; map relations suggest that this thinning could have taken place across faults active at the time of deposition",

Lower 60 to 70 percent of unit consists of thickbedded to massive, light- to dark-gray dolomite that typically weathers to resistant crags and ledges. The dolomite typically forms alternating thick intervals of relatively lighter and darker color; thicknesses of five such intervals that compose one exceptionally well exposed section are, from top to bottom, 30 m (medium gray), 30 m (light gray), 40 m (medium to dark gray), 35 m (light gray), and 70 m (medium gray). Plane-laminated, medium- to coarse-grained dolomite is common in the basal 10 m of unit. Total thickness ~350–390 m.Lower contact is generally sharp but locally gradational with dolomite in upper part of Dunderberg Shale (Cd). Unmapped internal contact between upper and lower parts of unit is indistinct and probably gradational. Black dolomite beds in upper part of unit are equivalent to Ironside Member of the Sultan Limestone and have yielded conodonts of late Middle to early Late Devonian age (Miller, 1983); these beds are discontinuous and could not be used as a basis for mapping the base of the Sultan Limestone. Rocks above the black dolomite are equivalent to lower part of the Valentine Member of the Devonian Sultan Limestone (Hazzard, 1954; Miller, 1983), and rocks below the black dolomite are interpreted as equivalent to the Devonian and Ordovician Mountain Springs Formation of Miller and Zilinsky (1981). Lower part of unit is equivalent to the Cambrian Cornfield Springs Formation of Palmer and Hazzard, 1956) excluding the basal Dunderberg Shale Member, which here is mapped as a separate formation",

Cbb,,"Bonanza King Formation, Banded Mountain Member (Cambrian)","Dolomite and minor limestone. Primarily light- to dark-gray, thin- to thick-bedded dolomite characterized by well-developed bedding and lamination. Bedding defined by layers of alternating shades of gray, brownish-gray, and yellowish-gray that create a distinctive color-banded appearance or by parting planes in thick sequences of uniform color. Most beds, especially those of relatively light color, are strongly laminated; most lamination is planar, but some is undulatory or domiform which suggests a possible stromatolitic origin. Brown chert lenses are present in many beds, especially those of light-gray color; in addition, some beds contain large, domiform masses of brown chert that could be silicified stromatolites. A few beds contain yellowish-brown silty laminae. Upper 40 to 45 percent of unit is predominantly light to medium gray; lower 55 to 60 percent is predominantly medium to dark gray. Lower part of unit includes a distinctive sequence of medium- to dark-gray limestone several tens of meters thick; this limestone is characterized by irregular laminae and thin beds of light-gray dolomite that create a mottled appearance, similar to limestone of the underlying Papoose Lake Member. Lowermost 5 to 10 m of member typically consists of very dark gray, massive, ledge-forming dolomite that sharply overlies the recessive beds at top of the Papoose Lake Member. Thickness ~300 m ",

Upper half of unit, corresponding approximately to the Wood Canyon Formation, is composed of reddish-brown-weathering, fine- to medium-grained, thin- to thick-bedded quartzite and minor interbedded siltstone. The quartzite is characterized by ubiquitous planar and cross lamination; detrital grains are well sorted, tightly packed, and include minor feldspar and mica in addition to the dominant quartz. Lower half of unit, corresponding approximately to the Stirling Quartzite, is primarily composed of thick-bedded to massive, light-gray to cream-colored, medium- to coarse-grained quartzite and conglomeratic quartzite that locally contain angular to rounded quartzite clasts as much as 3 cm in diameter. The moderately sorted to well-sorted quartzite contains 2–5 percent detrital feldspar that is mostly microcline but also includes minor plagioclase; some quartzite has a calcareous cement. This thick-bedded to massive quartzite typically forms an upper and a lower sequence of resistant strata separated by a middle, less resistant sequence of medium- to dark-gray, thin-bedded, fine-grained quartzite and siltstone. Lower contact of unit is sharp. Unit was regarded as the middle part of the Prospect Mountain Quartzite by Hazzard; identified as Wood Canyon Formation and Stirling Quartzite by Stewart (1970), who also noted the inconspicuous and subtle contact between these two formations in this area.

Xm,,"Metamorphic and plutonic rocks, undivided (Paleoproterozoic)","Gneiss, granitoid rocks, pegmatite, and quartz-rich metasedimentary(?) or metavolcanic(?) rocks; unit forms featureless slopes in contrast to overlying well-bedded sedimentary rocks. Dominant rock type is strongly foliated, finegrained, equigranular, quartz-feldspar-biotite gneiss composed of alternating felsic and mafic layers 1–4 mm thick. Thicker layers of predominantly felsic and mafic composition, however, are also common. Felsic layers typically contain subequal amounts of potassium feldspar, plagioclase, and quartz, although potassium feldspar commonly is subordinate or even absent; mafic layers contain as much as 80 percent biotite. Average grain size in most samples is less than 1 mm. Gneissic layers are almost invariably planar; in a few places they are deformed by small-scale folds. Gneiss is undated in map area but extends northward where it is dated as Paleoproterozoic (~1,710 Ma; Wooden and Miller, 1990; Miller and others, 2007). Gneiss is locally associated with subordinate unfoliated to weakly foliated granitoid rocks and pegmatite. In northwestern part of area and locally along east flank of Providence Mountains near C&K Mine, sizeable parts of unit consist of lightgray to light-brown, unfoliated, fine-grained, equigranular rocks composed of subequal quartz and feldspar (plagioclase ≥ potassium feldspar) with few or no mafic minerals; average grain size is less than 1 mm, many quartz grains are rounded, and the texture suggests a sedimentary or possibly volcanic origin.
