Qls,Landslide deposits (Pleistocene and Holocene),"Landslides are intentionally omitted from most of this map because they are so numerous they would conceal much of the information on bedrock geology. Only a few of the large landslide areas are shown. For more comprehensive reports of landslides in the area, see Nilsen and others (1979) and Ellen and Wieczorek (1988). In addition, a list of pertinent literature on landslides in Contra Costa County is provided by White (1990)."
