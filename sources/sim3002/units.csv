Tn,,Nonmarine rocks of Santa Barbara Canyon (“Pato red beds”) (lower Miocene and upper Oligocene?),"In the Santa Barbara Canyon area (Fox Mountain quadrangle; Vedder, 1968), the following units were originally placed in the Pato Red Member (now abandoned) of the Vaqueros Formation (Tv) by English (1916), but due to their nonmarine depositional environment were subsequently placed in the Caliente Formation (Tc) by Hill and others (1958). However, the early Miocene and late Oligocene(?) age of these rocks is older than Caliente rocks mapped in the Caliente Range that are at least as young as late Miocene (Vedder and Repenning, 1975), as well as rocks in the southern part of the New Cuyama quadrangle, where tentative Caliente beds overlie upper Miocene rocks of the Santa Margarita Sandstone (Tsm) (Vedder and Repenning, 1975). In addition, in the Lockwood Valley and Dry Creek regions, rocks mapped as Caliente Formation (Tc) are as young as uppermost Miocene (Carman, 1964; James, 1963; Kellogg, 1999; Kellogg and Miggins, 2002), also younger than the nonmarine rocks of Santa Barbara Canyon. The nonmarine rocks of Santa Barbara Canyon also underlie rocks mapped as lower Miocene Vaqueros Formation (unit Tv of this map), which, if they are Caliente Formation, is stratigraphically inconsistent with relationships to the north and east, where Vaqueros beds underlie or interfinger with rocks mapped as Caliente Formation (Vedder and Repenning, 1975; Minor, 2004). The nonmarine rocks of Santa Barbara Canyon, at least in part, may correlate more properly with similar rocks of the nonmarine Sespe Formation (Tsp) to the south in Domain 1. Until these stratigraphic problems are resolved, rocks mapped by Vedder (1968) as “Caliente Formation of Hill, Carlson, and Dibblee (1958)” are here called the nonmarine rocks of Santa Barbara Canyon (informally referred to as “Pato red beds”).
