af,,Artificial fill (Historic),"Man-made deposit of various materials and ages. Some are compacted and quite firm, but fills made before 1965 are nearly everywhere not compacted and consist simply of dumped materials"
alf,,Artificial levee fill (Historic),"Man-made deposit of various materials and ages, forming artificial levees as much as 20 feet (6.5 meters) high. Some are compacted and quite firm, but fills made before 1965 are almost everywhere not compacted and consist simply of dumped materials. The distribution of levee fill conforms to levees shown on the most recent U.S. Geological Survey 7.5 minute quadrangles"
Qhasc,,Artificial stream channels (Historic),"Modified stream channels, usually where streams have been straightened and realigned, but also including those channels that are confined within artificial dikes and levees"
Qhaf1,,Younger alluvial fan deposits (Holocene),"Brown, poorly-sorted, dense, sandy or gravelly clay. Small fans at mountain fronts have a probable debris flow origin. Larger Qhaf1 fans away from mountain fronts may represent the modern loci of deposition for Qhaf"
Qhaf,,Alluvial fan and fluvial deposits (Holocene),"Alluvial fan deposits are brown or tan, medium dense to dense, gravely sand or sandy gravel that generally grades upward to sandy or silty clay. Near the distal fan edges, the fluvial deposits are typically brown, never reddish, medium dense sand that fines upward to sandy or silty clay. The best developed Holocene alluvial fans are on the San Francisco Bay plain. All other alluvial fans and fluvial deposits are confined to narrow valley floors"
Qhb,,Basin deposits (Holocene),Very fine silty clay to clay deposits occupying flat-floored basins at the distal edge of alluvial fans adjacent to the bay mud (Qhbm )
Qhbs,,"Basin deposits, salt-affected (Holocene)","Clay to very fine silty-clay deposits similar to the Qhb deposits except that they contain carbonate nodules and iron-stained mottles (U.S. Soil Conservation Service, 1958). These deposits may have been formed by the interaction of bicarbonate-rich upland water and saline water of the San Francisco Bay estuary. With minor exceptions, salt-affected basin deposits are in contact with bay mud deposits, Qhbm"
Qhbm,,Bay mud (Holocene),"Water saturated estuarine mud, predominantly gray, green, and blue clay and silty clay underlying marshlands and tidal mud flats of San Francisco Bay. The upper surface is covered with cordgrass (Spartina sp.) and pickleweed (Salicornia sp.). The mud also contains a few lenses of well- sorted, fine sand and silt, a few shelly layers (oysters), and peat. The mud interfingers with and grades into fine-grained deposits at the distal edge of Holocene fans and was deposited during the post-Wisconsin rise in sea-level, about 12 ka to present (Imbrie and others, 1984). Estimated thickness: 0-40 m. In places it rests unconformably on bedrock"
Qhbr,,Beach ridge deposits (Holocene),"Long narrow ridge of probably well-sorted sand inferred from 1939 imagery. Observed between Emeryville and Berkeley, these deposits are now beneath the Interstate 80 roadbed"
Qhfp,,Floodplain deposits (Holocene),"Medium to dark gray, dense, sandy to silty clay. Lenses of coarser material (silt, sand, and pebbles) may be locally present. Floodplain deposits usually occur between levee deposits (Qhl) and basin deposits (Qhb)"
Qhl,,Natural levee deposits (Holocene),"Loose, moderately-sorted to well-sorted sandy or clayey silt grading to sandy or silty clay. These deposits are porous and permeable and provide conduits for transport of ground water. Levee deposits border stream channels, usually both banks, and slope away to flatter floodplains and basins. Levee deposits are best developed along San Pablo and Wildcat Creeks on the bay plain in Richmond. Abandoned levee systems have also been mapped"
Qhsc,,Stream channel deposits (Holocene),"Poorly-sorted to well-sorted sand, silt, silty sand, or sandy gravel with minor cobbles. Cobbles are more common in the mountainous valleys. Many stream channels are presently lined with concrete or riprap. Engineering works such as diversion dams, drop structures, energy dissipaters, and percolation ponds also modify the original channel. Many stream channels have been straightened, and these are labeled Qhasc. This straightening is especially prevalent in the lower reaches of streams entering the estuary. The mapped distribution of stream channel deposits is controlled by the depiction of major creeks on the most recent U.S. Geological Survey 7.5 minute quadrangles. Only those deposits related to major creeks are mapped. In some places these deposits are under shallow water for some or all of the year, as a result of reservoir release and annual variation in rainfall"
Qds,,Dune sand (Holocene and Pleistocene),"Fine-grained, very well sorted, well-drained, eolian deposits. They occur mainly in large sheets, as well as many small hills, most displaying Barchan morphology. Dunes display as much as 30 m of erosional relief and are presently being buried by basin deposits (Qhb ) and bay mud (Qhbm ). They probably began accumulating after the last interglacial high stand of sea level began to recede about 71 ka, continued to form when sea level dropped to its Wisconsin minimum about 18 ka, and probably ceased to accumulate after sea level reached its present elevation (about 6 ka). Atwater (1982) recognized buried paleosols in the dunes, indicating periods of nondeposition"
Qms,,Merritt sand (Holocene and Pleistocene),"Fine-grained, very well sorted, well-drained eolian deposits of western Alameda County. The Merritt sand outcrops in three large areas in Oakland and Alameda. Previously thought to be only of Pleistocene age, the Merrit sand is probably time-correlative with unit Qds, based on similar interfingering with Holocene bay mud (Qhbm ) and presumably similar depositional environments associated with long-term sea-level fluctuations. The Merrit sand displays different morphology from unit Qds, however, forming large sheets up to 15 meters high with yardang morphology"
Qls,,Landslide deposits (Holocene and/or Pleistocene),"Poorly sorted clay, silt, sand, and gravel. Only a few very large landslides have been mapped. For a more complete map of landslide deposits, see Nilsen and others (1979)"
Qpaf,,Alluvial fan and fluvial deposits (Pleistocene),"Brown, dense, gravely and clayey sand or clayey gravel that fines upward to sandy clay. These deposits display various sorting and are located along most stream channels in the county. All Qpaf deposits can be related to modern stream courses. They are distinguished from younger alluvial fans and fluvial deposits by higher topographic position, greater degree of dissection, and stronger soil profile development. They are less permeable than Holocene deposits and locally contain fresh water mollusks and extinct late Pleistocene vertebrate fossils. They are overlain by Holocene deposits on lower parts of the alluvial plain and incised by channels that are partly filled with Holocene alluvium on higher parts of the alluvial plain. Maximum thickness is unknown but at least 50 m"
Qpaf1,,Alluvial terrace deposits (Pleistocene),"Deposits consist of crudely bedded, clast-supported gravels, cobbles, and boulders with a sandy matrix. Clasts as much as 35 cm intermediate diameter are present. Coarse sand lenses may be locally present. Pleistocene terrace deposits are cut into Qpaf alluvial fan deposits a few meters and lie up to several meters above Holocene deposits"
Qmt,,Marine terrace deposits (Pleistocene),"Three small outcrops of marine terraces are located about 5 m above present mean sea level. Similar terraces are located north of the map area on the south shore of San Pablo Bay in the extreme northwest Contra Costa County at Lone Tree Point, Wilson Point, and an unnamed outcrop in between (Helley and Graymer, 1997b). The oyster beds at the base of those outcrops unconformably overlie the Cierbo Sandstone of Miocene Age and are in turn overlain by about 5 m of greenish-gray silty mudstone. The oysters have been dated by the Uranium-Thorium method (Helley and others, 1993) and are of last interglacial age, approximately 125 ka"
Qpoaf,,Older alluvial fan deposits (Pleistocene),"Brown dense gravely and clayey sand or clayey gravel that fines upward to sandy clay. These deposits display various sorting qualities. All Qpoaf deposits can be related to modern stream courses. They are distinguished from younger alluvial fans and fluvial deposits by higher topographic position, greater degree of dissection, and stronger profile development. They are less permeable than younger deposits, and locally contain freshwater mollusks and extinct Pleistocene vertebrate fossils"
QTi,,Irvington Gravels of Savage (1951) (Pleistocene and Pliocene?),"Poorly to well consolidated, distinctly bedded pebbles and cobbles, gray pebbly sand, and gray, coarse-grained, cross-bedded sand. Cobbles and pebbles are well- to sub-rounded, and as much as 25 cm in diameter, and consist of about 60 percent micaceous sandstone, 35 percent metamorphic and volcanic rocks and chert probably derived from the Franciscan complex, and 5 percent black laminated chert and cherty shale derived from the Claremont Formation. In the map area, these gravels are limited to several very small outcrops in the San Leandro quadrangle, thought to be offset from the main exposures of this unit in Fremont, south of the map area, by movement on the Hayward fault zone (Graymer, 1999). A large suite of early Pleistocene vertebrate fossils from this unit in quarries in Fremont was described by Savage (1951)"
QTu,,Undifferentiated continental gravels (Pleistocene and/or Pliocene),"Semi-consolidated to unconsolidated poorly sorted gravel, sand, silt, and clay distributed in isolated patches throughout the map area. These deposits are unrelated to modern drainages and are most abundant in the Walnut Creek- Concord Valley (Briones Valley quadrangle) and in patches that appear to represent an ancestral drainage emanating from the north face of Mt. Diablo flowing northwesterly down the Clayton-Concord valley northeast of the map area. Their main distinction is not being related to modern drainage or Pleistocene drainage. Thickness varies but most outcrop areas exceed 50 m. No soil profile development is preserved at most localities due to erosion. These deposits probably reflect the late Cenozoic uplift of the Coast Ranges (Jones and others, 1994)"

Tor,,Orinda Formation (late Miocene),"Distinctly to indistinctly bedded, nonmarine, pebble to boulder conglomerate, conglomeratic sandstone, coarse- to medium-grained lithic sandstone, and green and red siltstone and mudstone. Conglomerate clasts are subangular to well rounded, and contain a high percentage of detritus derived from the Franciscan complex"
Tcc,,Claremont chert (late to middle Miocene),"Laminated and bedded chert, minor brown shale, and white sandstone. Chert crops out as distinct, massive to laminated, gray or brown beds as much as 10 cm thick with thin shale partings. Distinctive black, laminated chert crops out locally in the Berkeley Hills. Lawson (1914) named rocks of this unit and coeval rocks elsewhere in and around the map area Claremont Shale, but within the area of Assemblage I, including Claremont Canyon, this unit is made up of much more chert than shale. Therefore, in this report I use the informal name Claremont chert for the rocks in Assemblage I and the formally accepted name Claremont Shale (Tcs) for coeval rocks in other assemblages where shale is the dominant lithology."

Tts,,Tuffaceous sandstone (Miocene and/or Oligocene),"Light-gray tuffaceous sandstone and tuff, with minor conglomerate and siltstone, marine. Clark (1918) correlated this unit with the Kirker Tuff, which crops out north of Mount Diablo, east of the map area, based on similar lithology and the presence in both units of 11 fossil species, including Acila shumardi. Durham (1944) indicated that A. shumardi is indicative of a late Oligocene age, the accepted age for the Kirker Tuff, but the underlying San Ramon Sandstone is considered to be early Miocene. This apparent contradiction has caused me to use the less restricted age indicated"
Tsr,,San Ramon Sandstone (Miocene and/or Oligocene),"Massive, medium- to coarse-grained, fossiliferous, marine sandstone. The accepted age for this unit is early Miocene, based on Addicott (1970) who noted that Weaver and others (1944) had reclassified the molluscan zone of the San Ramon Sandstone fauna (Echinophoria apta) from late Oligocene to early Miocene. However, Kleinpell (1938) reported early Zemorrian foraminifera from this unit. Weaver and others (1944) classified the Zemorrian as early Miocene (probably based on the relationships in this unit), but more recent work on foraminiferal zonation by McDougall (1983) has shown the Zemorrian zone to be entirely Oligocene. In addition, the San Ramon Sandstone underlies tuffaceous sandstone and tuff correlated with the Kirker Tuff, which is considered to be Oligocene. The contradiction in accepted ages of the two units and the contradiction of foraminiferal and molluscan zonation has caused me to use the less restricted age indicated"
