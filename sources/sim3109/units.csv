Qaa,ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS,Active alluvial fan deposit (Holocene),"Alluvial fan deposits characterized by surfaces and channels that actively receive or have received sediments within the last few years or decades. Composed of unconsolidated, poorly sorted gravel and sand in channels, fine sands and silts in overbank deposits. Deposit consists of active channel and young terrace or bar deposits. The annually active channel surfaces are a small part of the unit and form discrete channels that are commonly smooth. Terrace deposits with rough microtopography; strongly developed bar and swale throughout much of the extent of fan; less pronounced microtopography in distal fan. No soil development in active channels and little or no soil development, which may be expressed as accumulations of silt in the upper horizon, in terrace deposits. Surfaces active on a decadal scale form terraces 10 to 60 cm above active channels. Deposits inset into most of older alluvial deposits. Surfaces commonly lack annual and perennial vegetation on surfaces active on annual to decadal scale and are moderately to heavily inhabited with annual and perennial vegetation on surfaces or channels active on decadal to centennial scale. Perennial vegetation commonly consists of creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) and white bursage (Ambrosia dumosa). Surfaces are prone to flooding and sheet flow during intense or long-lasting precipitation events. Active channels inferred to be less than 10 to 20 years or less based on flooding frequency, terrace and bar deposits ranging from 20 to 100 years based on flooding frequency from air photography at different times, and 19th and 20th century tracks and trails buried by these deposits.
